HackerRank determines the cut-offs for each proficiency in a skill-based on inputs from SMEs and how the top 10% of the employees have scored in a particular assessment that determines the skill proficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">In the case of custom assessments (tailored to meet organization's requirements), the organizations set the cut-offs.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\"><br><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">What if I take multiple assessments that assess the same skill?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The Skill Rating would be based on the results from the most recent assessment taken. This will help us keep the Skill Rating accurate and up-to-date to enable your decision-making process.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">How can I access past Skill Ratings?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">In the profile of an employee, you can go to the Skill Details section to see the progress of Skill Ratings over a period of time.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">How many retakes are allowed for an assessment?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The employer will determine the number of retakes for each assessment based on their policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The cool-down period is determined as the days to pass before taking the next retake. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">What is the difference between Skill Ratings and Badges?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Skill Rating is a quantitative indicator of an individual's proficiency in technical skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Badges, on the other hand, are a way of acknowledging an achievement or a skill acquisition at a skill proficiency level. You can receive a badge when you have taken an assessment and reached proficiency level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">For example, If you take a Java assessment and achieve the required Skill Rating for expert proficiency, you will receive the Java (Expert) ^ badge.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">What happens to my skill rating if the assessment is retired or updated?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">An assessment is considered retired if it is deleted from HRW. You will continue to see the assessment scores in the Assessment History, but your Skill Rating will reflect the most recent Rating before the retired assessment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">An assessment is considered updated if the content of the assessment is changed. Your Skill Rating will not be affected if an assessment is updated.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">How can I add custom learning resources to SkillUp?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">You must provide an Excel sheet with the links to custom learning resources like Pluralsight videos or Udacity courses. Within two business days, the HackerRank team will manually add these links to the relevant skills. In the future, you can add custom resources through the admin dashboard.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Can I influence the content in certification assessments? </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">No, you cannot influence or customize the content in the certification assessments. Hackerrank is taking a strategic bet on AI-first learning and will invest in providing guided, immersive AI tutors for each skill and role. The certification content will be Hackerrank's proprietary AI-powered assessments.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">What is the difference between a badge and a certification? </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">A badge is earned for demonstrating proficiency in a skill after passing a skill assessment. Certification is earned for a role that combines multiple skills after passing a comprehensive role assessment that includes prerequisites of earning the relevant skill badges.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Can I transfer skill badges earned outside the company (e.g., on the HackerRank community) to my employer's SkillUp account?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Currently, you cannot transfer external skill badges into your organization's SkillUp account. SkillUp treats personal community certifications separately from professional employer certifications to maintain data privacy and boundaries.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">How often are the global in-demand skills updated on the SkillUp platform?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The global in-demand skills showcased on SkillUp are updated annually based on HackerRank's skills report research. However, the company is exploring increasing the frequency of these updates.</span></p>\n<p><br><br><br></p>","title":"HackerRank SkillUp"}
