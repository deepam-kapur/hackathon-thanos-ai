This task is ideal for more senior-level candidates who are expected to have existing industry experience. They may be managers, mentors, or simply contributing members of a high performing team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Code Review questions are manually graded, as there is no automated way to read the feedback or judge their expertise. However, written comments from the candidate can provide a really good signal of their seniority and experience in a relatively short amount of time for the candidate.Â </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vo679FLGG84\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to add Code Review questions to a test</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To add a Code Review question, follow these steps:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a new test or open an existing test</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add a question from the library<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360087779574/mceclip0.png\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Select Code Review in the Type search area<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360088928853/mceclip1.png\" alt=\"mceclip1.png\"></span></li>\n</ol>","title":"Code Review Questions - Discarded"}
