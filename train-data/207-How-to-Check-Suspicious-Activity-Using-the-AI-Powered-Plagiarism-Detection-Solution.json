HackerRank’s AI-powered model for plagiarism detection will help you identify suspicious cases more precisely.</p>\n<p>HackerRank for Work provides detailed Test Reports which describe a candidate's performance in a Test. The Test Reports are generated after the Candidates have submitted a Test. The topics below describe how to use AI-powered plagiarism detection when reviewing candidate test reports.</p>\n<p>For more information on how HackerRank's AI-power plagiarism detection works, see the support article <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/16146609166483-AI-Powered-Plagiarism-Detection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI-powered Plagiarism Detection</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01H84NBN62GRSVVTFSHDTGAV6T\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It is recommended to have a HackerRank for Work account.</li>\n<li>You must have at least one test attempted by Candidates and their submissions pending for further evaluation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"01H84NBN62H768KTJMR7P9W5DE\">Verifying Plagiarism Activity on Candidate Reports</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>Tests</strong> page and select the required Test.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Candidates</strong> tab on the right.
