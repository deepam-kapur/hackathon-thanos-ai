It is more aggravated in the case of large campus events. This leads to many of HackerRank library/custom questions getting leaked.</p>\n<p>To prevent that, HackerRank is launching the capability to add Watermarks on the questions inside a test. Enabling this feature would add the logged-in user's email ID as a watermark on the question section of the assessment page. This would act as a nudge to deter candidates from taking pictures of HackerRank’s question content and sharing it on social channels like Telegram, which would lead to their identity being leaked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HMY24QHM5MATTY6NSK64ACPK\">Enabling Watermarking in Tests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can open the test for which you want to enable the watermark feature, click on <strong>Settings, </strong>and select <strong>Test Integrity </strong>from the side menu.  <img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/17817810561171\" alt=\"Test\">\n</li>\n<li>In test Integrity settings, scroll down to find the <strong>Watermarking </strong>option.
