Are the test questions relevant to the work that the developer will actually be doing in the role? Are they engaging and appropriately challenging for developers? Are you providing a good candidate experience? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use the Assessment Quality Health to consistently measure the effectiveness of your recruiting workflow, and identify ways to streamline it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the </span><strong>View more details</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> option in this section to see the rating of the factors which contribute to the overall AQH.

If your test is too long, you slow down your hiring process, and some candidates will feel that they have to devote too much time to your test. If your test is too short, candidates will have a stressful experience and feel that their performance does not represent their true ability. The attempt duration metric helps you determine whether your test’s length is well-calibrate, not too long, and not too short.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">\n<p><strong>Measure</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> = Spread of attempt duration</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If candidates are finishing the test too quickly, it might be too easy.
