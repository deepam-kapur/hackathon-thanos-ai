Individual test cases consisting of input / output pairs are set up by the question creator. Each test case is assigned a score, and the total possible score for the question is the sum of all the scores of the test cases.<br><br>When a candidate runs their code to check their solution during a test (and when their final solution is checked after the test is completed), their code is successively supplied each test case input to STDIN. The output generated by the candidate’s code for each test case input is compared with the test case’s pre-configured output. If they are equal, the test case is passed and its point value is added to the candidate’s score for the question. Otherwise, no points are awarded for that test case. The candidate’s score for a coding question is the sum of the scores of each test case that passes.<br><br>In addition to a score, HackerRank also provides some additional information to help you evaluate a piece of code's optimality. In the candidate report, we give you the time spent and memory used by the candidate's solution for each test case (see screenshots below). This lets you quickly assess the candidate's code for efficiency; there's more to programming than getting the right answer!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/218801307/Screen_Shot_2016-12-07_at_3.00.45_PM.png\" alt=\"\"></p>","title":"Coding"}
