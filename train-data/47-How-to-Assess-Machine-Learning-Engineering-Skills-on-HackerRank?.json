Using the hands-on questions in our library, candidates can be measured on practical demonstrations and multiple solution paths. For example, Data Science Machine Learning questions in the HackerRank library involve training a logistic regression classifier, training a Naive Bayes classifier, predicting future models of given data, among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some examples of </span><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/work/library/hackerrank?copyscrape=true&amp;skill_ids=d063718956a5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Science hands-on project questions in our library</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are as below.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402921141779/image1.png\" alt=\"image1.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, deep learning, PyTorch, and TensorFlow hands-on tasks test the understanding of fundamental concepts such as NLP, building a deep neural network, among others.
