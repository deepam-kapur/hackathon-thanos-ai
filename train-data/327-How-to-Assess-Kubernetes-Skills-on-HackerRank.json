This also usually relates also to other skills like Docker and DevOps in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a candidate takes a test consisting of Kubernetes questions, we set up their own sandbox Linux virtual machine with Docker and Kubernetes preinstalled to log in remotely through SSH. Developers can be asked to perform tasks such as: creating clusters, listing clusters, management of containers in clusters. For instance, solving HackerRank’s Kubernetes questions tests both theoretical and practical knowledge of the skill. For example, assessing the knowledge of what node stands for in Kubernetes terminology and then implement a solution to display a list of nodes inside the cluster.
