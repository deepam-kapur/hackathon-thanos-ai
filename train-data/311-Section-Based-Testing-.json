This makes the test more organized and divides the entire test into different topics or themes for testing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you are interviewing candidates for the position of software developer and want to test candidates on algorithms, C++, and Java, you can then create three different sections for these topics namely: Algorithms, C++, and Java.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also organize questions in each section based on their difficulty and/or type. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section-based testing also allows you to customize the test further by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing candidates to revisit a previous section after he finishes solving questions from a further section, etc.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, you can save time in one section which can roll over into the next section to allow greater utilization of time.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating Test Sections and How to Use Them </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use the test sections option to divide your test into different sections. You must have a minimum of one question in your test to enable this setting. </span></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When you are creating a test that you want to section, you must add questions to the test sequentially.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must have created a test with a minimum of one question.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the <strong>Tests</strong> tab on the home page and then click the required test.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the question(s) are ordered and ready to be put into a section, you can create the section by clicking on the '<strong>+</strong>' sign. You can reorder questions once a section is created too.</span><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360102083634/Create_Section.png\" alt=\"Create_Section.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<center><em>The option to create Test sections</em></center>\n<p class=\"box info\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Note</strong>: Inversely, you can create as many sections as you want, and then add questions to each section.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difficulty level and score of all the questions going into a section should ideally be the same.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Warning</strong>: If the difficulty level and score of all the questions in a section are not the same, a warning is displayed as shown below. If the section is randomly picking some questions and bundling them together as a test, such a scenario will be disadvantageous to candidates. We will discuss this in more detail shortly.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360102083654/Warning_Message.png\" alt=\"Warning_Message.png\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Warning message displayed when the section has questions of varying complexities</em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On clicking the '+' sign, you will see 3 options, select 'Create Section'  and/or `Add another section'(if the test already has existing sections) and the questions will now be bundled together in a section. </span><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360029814334/add_another_section.jpg\" alt=\"add_another_section.jpg\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<center><em> Adding additional sections in the Test </em></center>\n<ul>\n<li>When a new section is created there are options to either add questions to the section from the library or create a new question. You can select existing questions and move them to the new section.
