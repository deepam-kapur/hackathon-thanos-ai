It hosts a collection of reports and scorecards of all the tests and interviews that a candidate has taken part in, for a particular role.</span><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Purpose of the Candidate Packet</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, in HackerRank, Tests and Interview reports of a particular candidate are not grouped together. This does not offer the best user experience to the hiring panel when they conduct a candidate debrief and make a hiring decision.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to help our customers while making hiring decisions, we have aggregated all the available reports and scorecards of a candidate and projected them in the form of a skill summary report inside the Candidate Packet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is how a typical Candidate Packet looks like.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402772309779/Skills_on_HR_-_Insights.jpg\" alt=\"Skills_on_HR_-_Insights.jpg\"></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viewing a Candidate Packet</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can view the Candidate Packet from the below locations inside your HackerRank for Work account.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidate List Inside a Test  </span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open any test and go to the <strong>Candidates</strong> tab. </span></li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the Candidate Packet icon (as shown in the below screenshot) to open the candidate packet of the particular candidate.</span><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/1500007434922/view_candidate_packet.png\" alt=\"view_candidate_packet.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside a Candidate's Test Report </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on any candidate inside a Test to open the candidate’s test summary report.

The skills are collapsed by default. When you expand each skill, you will be able to see how the candidate has faired in that skill so far. The skill summary tab also has a section called \"Additional Info\". This section shows a summary of the additional skills of a candidate that are not mapped to any role.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the images below to understand the skill summary report and the signals that it sends.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402779573395/Candidate_Packet_-_Skill_Summary.jpg\" alt=\"Candidate_Packet_-_Skill_Summary.jpg\"></span></p>\n<h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timeline  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Candidate Timeline is available inside the Candidate Packet. You can access it by clicking on the candidate's row from the Candidates’ list. Under the timeline tab, you can see all the previous events, including the tests and interviews and their reports, in the order of their occurrence. You can view or share these reports and download them in the form of PDF by clicking on the respective options. Also, you can add the time of an attempt, mark the status of an attempt, and re-invite the candidate to take a test. You can find these options by clicking on the three-dot icon which will trigger a drop-down menu with these actions.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case a test or an interview is in Scheduled status, you can copy the link to the same by clicking on the Copy Link option.
