The interactive graphs allow you to analyze trends in scores over time, question difficulty, and overall test completion.</p>\n<p>Specifically, you can view score distribution graphs to see how your candidates are performing on a bell curve. The question-level analysis shows time taken per question compared to question accuracy. This shows which questions may need refining based on completion rates. Finally, the candidate performance graph demonstrates each individuals' scoring and pacing compared to the average.</p>\n<p>These visual representations give actionable insights into a test's efficiency. You can use the trends to refine questions, pass top performers to the next hiring stage, or determine how well the test screens candidates' abilities. Optimizing a skills test leads to better candidate matches and a smoother hiring process. The user-friendly analytics make it easy to improve your assessments over time based on real data.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Note:</span></strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #444746; background-color: #ffffff;\">HackerRank has made background changes to the existing insights to optimize performance and customizability.

Distribution of Candidates Scores </h4>\n<p>This graph represents different range of scores achieved by candidates who have submitted the Test. Hover your mouse over a particular range indicated in the graph, and the tooltip displays the number of candidates who have achieved a score in this range. </p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #444746;\">This score distribution graph helps you estimate the number or percentage of candidates likely to succeed in the Test and be considered for hiring.</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HJ6YYZ20W5AKX1CESGNVW2BZ\">B. Median Score </h4>\n<p>50% of the candidates who attempted this test scored less than or equal to this score.</p>\n<p>Indicates the median value from different candidates’ test scores. This value serves as a benchmark score to identify candidates who qualify and those who don’t.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HJ6YYZ20KP178K6VZW24SW83\">C. Median Attempt Time (Minutes)</h4>\n<p>50% of the candidates who attempted this test took less than or equal to this time.</p>\n<p>Indicates the median value from different candidates’ test completion times. This median value serves as a benchmark correlation to separate the faster and slower test takers.</p>\n<p><em>Example: If the value is 10m 45s, it implies that 50% of your candidates completed this Test in less than or equal to the median time.</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HJ6YYZ20W49MCCH2943WKMKD\">D. Median Time to Full Score (Minutes)</h4>\n<p>50% of the candidates who scored 100% on this test took less than or equal to this amount of time.</p>\n<p>Indicates the median value from different test completion times considering only those Tests in which candidates have achieved a full score. This median value serves as a benchmark correlation to separate test takers who achieved a full score in the shortest possible time.</p>\n<p><em>Example: If the value is 15m 30s, it implies that 50% of your candidates completed this Test with a full score in less than or equal to the median time.</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HJ6YYZ20Y6NMS3ESQ9V0FYNV\">E.
