Instead, you only need to specify five essential data points or prompts: the Event's goal, theme, target audience, participation type, and brand tone. </p>\n<p>Engage, powered by AI, creates a microsite, an email campaign, and a challenge that aligns with your requirements. You can edit these to match your needs.</p>\n<p>To create an event:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the Event onboard page, click <strong>Create Event</strong>.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/27845788774675\" alt=\"create_event_new.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Theme: For the event theme, mention if you have a specific theme. For example, Sustainability, else, just mention that you do not have one.

There can be more than one goal with your event; mention your primary goal here. It may be either hiring, branding, or engagement. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Participation type: Once you have selected the goal, select a participation type that suits your event. For example, a hiring event typically involves individuals, whereas hackathons have teams participating.

It is ideal to match this with your brand tone so that the content of the microsite and email campaigns replicate your brand voice. </li>\n<li>Click <strong>Generate Event</strong>.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/27407964513299\" width=\"646\" height=\"379\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent3\">An event with assets such as a microsite, email campaigns, and challenges is generated based on the inputs you have provided.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent3\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/27408016495123\" width=\"645\" height=\"367\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">Finally, if you want to make some changes to these inputs, go back to the setup page and complete the edits to re-generate the content as per your needs.</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/3dosdlz1qf.jsonp\" async=\"async\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js\" async=\"async\"></script>\n</p>\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_3dosdlz1qf seo=true videoFoam=true\" style=\"height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_swatch\" style=\"height: 100%; left: 0; opacity: 0; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 0; transition: opacity 200ms; width: 100%;\"><img style=\"filter: blur(5px); height: 100%; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;\" src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/3dosdlz1qf/swatch\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRWKCZKJ8Y1GV9G01M1XYKPJ\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\" style=\"color: #666666;\">Review the Tasks and Tips on the Event Homepage</span></h2>\n<p>After configuring your Event, the Engage product guides you through subsequent steps on the Event Homepage.
