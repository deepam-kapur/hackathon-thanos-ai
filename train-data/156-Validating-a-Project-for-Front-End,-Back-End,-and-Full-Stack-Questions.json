A valid project should have the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The project must be less than <strong>5 MB</strong> in size.</li>\n<li>A <strong>hackerrank.yml</strong> configuration file in the root directory.</li>\n<li>The configuration should have all the required parameters.

No other port is exposed outside the machine.</li>\n<li>The scoring command should run successfully and produce a valid output.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">Follow <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005623688-Scoring-a-Full-stack-question\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scoring a Full Stack question </a>to learn about valid scoring methods for a project-based question's project. </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">How validation works</span></span></p>\n<p>To ensure the imported project is valid, a validation step is run automatically when a project is imported. Here is how the validation step works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure the project zip is less than 5 MB in size.</li>\n<li>Verify that hackerrank.yml is present in the root directory of the project.</li>\n<li>Validate hackerrank.yml for correct format and required values</li>\n<li>Start a server with the project zip and run the scoring command. This step can take some time.</li>\n<li>Once the scoring command has run successfully, the output is checked for a valid output.</li>\n<li>If the scoring output is valid, it is checked for a valid score. If test case weights are provided in the configuration file, they are also verified in this step.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A project must clear all steps to be considered valid.</p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note:</strong> The scoring command once ran, should finish within 5 minutes. If the scoring command takes longer than 5 minutes, a timeout error will happen.</p>","title":"Validating a Project for Front End, Back End, and Full Stack Questions"}
