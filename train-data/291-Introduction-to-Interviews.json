Typically, an interview can be conducted if a candidate is shortlisted from the first level of assessment. Interviews provide interviewers with the flexibility to recreate an experience similar to an on-site interview. It is a time-efficient and cost-effective method to evaluate candidates remotely. Our platform gives the interviewers the ability to gauge a candidate's coding and problem-solving ability in real-time. This article will give you an overall idea about HackerRank Interviews and its key features. </p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note: </strong>To understand the Interviews platform, you can try a sample interview as an interviewer using this <a href=\"https://hr.gs/newint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link.</a> You can also share the sample interview link with candidates to familiarize them with the platform before an interview. For candidates, you can share this link with them <a href=\"https://hr.gs/sampleint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://hr.gs/sampleint.</a></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<ul id=\"docs-internal-guid-8980cf80-7fff-f92d-493b-8213a26ed850\">\n<li>\n<strong>Access to the library</strong>: Interviewers can select any available questions in their personal library for interviews. This makes it easy to show the problem statement and code stub to candidates. Alternatively, the interviewers can create new questions or access the HackerRank library if required.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Code collaboration</strong>: All participants in the interview can edit code, provide input, and test code by running it live on our platform. The interviewer can monitor the changes made by the candidate in real-time.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Templates</strong>: Questions can be organized using Interview templates. These act as folders of questions grouped. Templates can be shared between hiring team members to make interviews more standardized across interviewers.

You can also move the chat widget on the interview screen wherever you want.  </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Playback feature</strong>: The automatically generated interview report recreates the entire interview for review by the hiring team. This ensures that other hiring team members, besides the interviewer, can also review candidates' interview performance in detail.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Scorecard: </strong>The interviewer review candidate feedback inside the Interview scorecard. The scorecard has different headings (or focus areas/skills) to assess the candidate. A star rating can also be provided for each of these skills. The scorecard is not visible to the candidate. Each interviewer in the interview has their own scorecard.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Built-in IDE</strong>: Interviews have a built-in IDE that supports many languages. This ensures that interviewers can evaluate the candidate as per their job requirements.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Built-in Whiteboard:  </strong>Interviews have the whiteboard integrated to help the interviewer evaluate the candidates on their system design capabilities. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interviews are dynamic, just like on-site interviews. It allows interviewers to change and customize questions after seeing the candidates' progress. For instance, if a candidate can solve the given questions quickly, the interviewer might decide to test the candidate on other skills in the questions that follow. </p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007439768-Key-Interview-Features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to learn more about the Key Interview Features.</p>\n<p><strong><br>We have a <a href=\"https://hackerrank.northpass.com/p/45310c43d92a71eb704fa7990cbb1168c54b0205\" target=\"_self\">HackerRank Interviews Learning Path</a> available on the <a href=\"https://hackerrank.northpass.com/auth/auth_url_email/login\" target=\"_self\">HackerRank Academy</a>!</strong></p>\n<p>This course covers how to conduct technical interviews with HackerRank.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantages of HackerRank Interviews</li>\n<li>Creating an Interview</li>\n<li>Initiating the Interview</li>\n<li>Interface Tour</li>\n<li>Interview Settings</li>\n<li>Joining the Interview and the Candidate's Perspective</li>\n<li>Ending an  Interview and Interview Reports</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackerrank.northpass.com/auth/auth_url_email/login\" target=\"_self\"><strong>HackerRank Academy</strong></a>: <span>Access the <a href=\"https://hackerrank.northpass.com/auth/auth_url_email/login\" target=\"_self\">HackerRank Academy</a> to view this learning path, or click on the </span><strong>Academy </strong><span>link in the footer of your browser window while logged in to the HackerRank Platform.
