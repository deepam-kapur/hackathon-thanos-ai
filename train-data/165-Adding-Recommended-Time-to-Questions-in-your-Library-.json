It is mandatory to add the recommended time at the time of question creation. For custom questions i.e questions created by platform users, the Recommended Time remains to be the time originally set when the question was created or a recommended time added by HackerRank. In this article, we will walk you through the steps in adding recommended time to questions in your library. </span></p>\n<h2><span>How to Add Recommended Time to Questions?</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To add Recommended Time to your Company Questions, you must have created a Question. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span>Click on the </span><strong>Library</strong><span> tab on the home page, and then click on the </span><strong>Create </strong><strong>Question</strong><span> button.</span>\n</li>\n<li><span>In the <strong>Select Question Type</strong> dialog box, select the type of question you wish to create. </span></li>\n<li><span>In the <strong>Problem Statement </strong>editor, specify the <strong>Recommended Time</strong> to solve the question in the given field, as shown below. <img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402318707731/recommended_time.jpg\" alt=\"recommended_time.jpg\"></span></li>\n<li><span>Once the Recommended Time has been added to a question, it is displayed in the <strong>Library</strong> along with the Question Name, tags, and more.
