In Code Review questions, Interviewers can share code written by someone else and ask the candidates to provide suggestions and comments to improve the code.</p>\n<p>In the Code Review questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Candidates and Interviewers will both be able to add comments to specific lines of the code</li>\n<li>Comments can be written with Markdown support for rich text (bold, italics, code snippet, and so on.)</li>\n<li>\"Grading Rubrics\"  can be added to help the Interviewers to view information regarding the code. They can refer to this information to assess the candidate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For information about how to create a Dode Review question, see <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053848873-Creating-a-Code-Review-Question\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a Code Review Question.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HDEBMJAF34Y6P6YR7K1QTGEP\">Code Review Question User Interface</h2>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-e5c2fb2b-7fff-9025-562b-19061faaaa7f\">The user interface of a Code Review question is intuitive, allowing you to add comments to the code, add Grading Rubrics, compare the code, and so on.</p>\n<p>This gif file helps you to understand a Code Review question.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/21891745359251\" alt=\"code_review_snagit.gif\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HBDAS4P0JVGPN76DWMAR9KVD\">Using Code Review Questions in Interviews </h2>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-aef87e1d-7fff-8f55-d561-313085b34f48\">You can use the existing Code Review questions in the HackerRank Library or the My Company library.
