Whenever you create a new Test, whether pre-defined or custom Test, the test is created as a draft. In this draft mode, you can edit the test, add or remove questions, and make necessary changes. When in draft mode, candidates cannot take the test.  </p>\n<h2>Creating a Test</h2>\n<p>HackerRank allows hiring managers to create tests to assess candidates.  </p>\n<p>Following are the two methods to create a test:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010826973-Creating-a-Role-Based-Test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a test based on a specific role</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on your role selection, a test for that role is generated. HackerRank has bundled together questions from the HackerRank Library into a test for certain pre-defined roles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005854267-Creating-a-Custom-Test-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a custom test</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can create new questions or choose questions from the library for a test. You can select questions from the HackerRank library that comprises all questions created by the HackerRank team, or, you can also add questions from your personal library if either your team members or you have created questions.</p>\n<p>Refer to the respective links to follow the steps for test creation in detail.</p>\n<p>The images shown below will take you through the process of test creation.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003262601/Select_Role.png\" alt=\"Select_Role.png\"></p>\n<center><em>Creating a Role-based Test</em></center>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003217922/Other.png\" alt=\"Other.png\"></p>\n<center><em>Creating a custom Test</em></center>\n<h2>Draft Mode</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you click on the <strong>Create Test</strong> button and fill in the required details, a new test is created, and this test will be in <strong>draft mode</strong>. </li>\n<li>In the image below, you can see that a newly created test is in draft mode unless <strong>published.</strong><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360102086394/Draft.png\" alt=\"Draft.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em>The created Tests in 'Draft' mode</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Once you have made all your edits to the test when you click on the <strong>publish </strong>option as shown below.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003262621/Publish.png\" alt=\"Publish.png\">\n</li>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">As soon as you click Publish, the <strong>Test is published</strong> message gets displayed on the screen. At this stage, your test gets available to candidates. You can invite candidates to your test once your test is published. <em>Try</em> test also becomes available.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360104254973/Test_Published.png\" alt=\"Test_Published.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em>Publishing a Test.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In scenarios where you want to edit or make changes to a test that is already published, you can move the test to draft mode from the three-dot menu as shown below.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360104254993/Move_To_Draft.png\" alt=\"Move_To_Draft.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em>Moving a Test to Draft mode</em></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> When a test is moved to Draft, nobody can attempt the test. If a candidate’s attempt is already in progress when the test is moved to draft mode, his/her test experience remains unaffected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Draft Mode of a test is particularly useful when there are multiple collaborators on a test. If you choose multiple people to make changes to a test, setting it to draft mode enables all people involved to make their changes without any hassles.</li>\n<li>If a test is in draft mode, it is indicated to be so, in the main tests menu, as shown below.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402630763411/Draft.png\" alt=\"Draft.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Also note that, when a test is still in draft mode and you attempt to navigate away from the test, the following dialogue box is displayed. You can choose to publish the test or navigate away and revisit it later for further changes.<img style=\"text-align: center;\" src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003262741/Navigate_Away.png\" alt=\"Navigate_Away.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>As long as the Test is in draft mode, candidates cannot attempt the test.</li>\n</ul>","title":"Draft Mode of a Test "}
