Candidates will see a notification to come back at a later time if they try to launch a test. We will also ensure that candidates are allowed to start their test only if they can complete it before the start of the maintenance window.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How does this impact interview sessions?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New interview sessions cannot start during the maintenance window, and up to 90 minutes prior to the start of the window. For sessions that are live as we approach the window, we will show warnings to the participants so they can complete their interviews. Interview data recorded before the maintenance window starts will be safe.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How does this impact my reports?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will not be able to view reports or dashboards during the downtime.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What happens to invites expiring on 10th Februrary?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For candidate test invites which expire on 10th February, we can increase the expiry date by a day in case you would want to do that.
