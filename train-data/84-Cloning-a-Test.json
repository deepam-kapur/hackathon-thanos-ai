Any changes made to the original test after the cloning will not reflect in the cloned test and vice versa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cloning a test, you can choose to add or remove questions to or from this cloned test as per your requirement or make changes to the test settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When trying to clone the test, if the test does not have job role and experience defined, you'll have to add those first before you can clone the test. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The naming convention for the cloned test is - </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&lt;Name of the original test&gt; (duplicate)</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloning a test does not create a clone of the questions present in that test. There is only one master copy of each question used in your test. When you edit any question, the master copy of that question gets updated. Thus, all tests (including the cloned one) that contain that question, will reflect the updated version of the question.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must have created a test.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGYVZ5HEGMH997MBPJA74BNF\">Steps to Clone a Test</h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the </span><strong>Tests </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tab on the home page and then click on the required test.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the test opens, you will see a three-dot menu beside the test name (denoted by three vertical ellipses).
