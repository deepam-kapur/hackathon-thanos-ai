Cloning an existing question breaks all ties of the question with the original.

Cloning questions is instrumental when you want to use different question versions with modifications in different contexts. This article will walk you through the steps in cloning a question. </p>\n<p><strong>Points to Remember</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All questions created by you and anyone in your company are available under '<strong>My Company Questions</strong>' in your HackerRank for Work account. </li>\n<li>HackerRank also has a vast and rich library of questions, available under '<strong>HackerRank Questions</strong>.' </li>\n<li>Questions under both categories can be cloned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"CloneHackerRankQuestions\"><strong>Cloning HackerRank Questions </strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>Library </strong>tab and then select the <strong>HackerRank Questions.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Next, hover your mouse right next to the question you want to clone.
