Please see here before</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we proceed to learn how to create and score questions on the HackerRank library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selenium is an open-source Web UI automation testing framework that supports automation across different browsers, platforms, and programming languages and provides a domain-specific language, Selenese, to write tests in C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Scala, among others. </span></p>\n<h2>Selenium Projects tasks in the HackerRank Library</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HackerRank's Projects questions associated with Selenium skills cover a wide array of topics. Ranging from basic operations to advanced skills, Selenium developers are assessed on competencies such as: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Broken link detection using Selenium</strong> - Broken links may exist due to some kind of server error, which, in turn, causes the corresponding webpages to malfunction and not be displayed. Automated Selenium testing for broken link detection, which requires the collection of all links, verifying the HTTP response code, and so on, is assessed with a Selenium Java question as shown below. In a similar fashion, our Selenium questions are also designed to assess the automated detection of broken iframes, images, anchors. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402384635027/selenium.jpg\" alt=\"selenium.jpg\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Form submission automation</strong> - Questions to assess login, registration, and automation testing abilities for form submission on web pages. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Web Authentication</strong> - Question to assess operations such as handling Authentication/Login Popup Window using Selenium WebDriver, implementation of WebAuthenticators, and so on.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Web Scraping</strong> - Questions to set up web-scraping to extract valuable data and information web browser automation, among others. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Data entry automation</strong> - Questions that assess data entry automation skills, including entry into web form from text or database.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other common competencies tested using HackerRank Selenium questions include Fundamental Java programming knowledge, knowledge of XPath, CSS, HTML, and DOM.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360088631874/Screenshot_2020-09-09_at_1.20.03_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_2020-09-09_at_1.20.03_PM.png\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: Validated by our <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-directory/skills-advisory-council\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HackerRank's Skills Advisory Council</a>, we also provide the <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-directory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HackerRank Skills Directory</a>,</span> which clearly defines the Selenium competencies that can be leveraged while assessing candidates.
