The rows returned by the candidate’s query are compared with the correct answer; if they match, full points are awarded. If they do not match, the candidate receives 0 points. You can configure whether or not row ordering is taken into account during grading under Advanced Settings in step 3 of question creation.<br><br>Note that you can retroactively change the score for any question of any type from the Detailed section of a candidate’s report. A candidate may receive 0 points on a DbRank question, but a look at their final answer reveals their query was almost correct. If you deem this worthy of some partial credit, feel free to update their score accordingly. You and your team can come to a consensus on how to handle cases like these, for all question types.</p>\n<p><img class=\"in-progress\" src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/115014440288\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/115014358607\"></p>","title":"DbRank"}
