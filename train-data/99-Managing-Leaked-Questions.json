HackerRank leak detection tool performs an automated search at regular intervals to identify questions from the library that get leaked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, if you come across a question available elsewhere, you can report the question to HackerRank.

But follow certain change management best practices.</p>\n<p>Here are some best practices you can follow when you encounter a leaked question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you find a leaked question in the library or during test creation, you should select the <strong>Hide Leaked Questions</strong> check box and use unleaked questions in tests.</li>\n<li>If an existing test has a question that is marked as leaked, you can:\n<ul>\n<li>Remove that question from the test or replace it with a similar unleaked question using the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009582313-Replacing-Leaked-Questions-in-Tests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Replace Questions<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"> </span>functionality</a>.</li>\n<li>If the test is in progress, you can use your discretion to monitor the plagiarism checker for that question more efficiently. If you would like more information about plagiarism detection, you can see <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005603547-Plagiarism-detection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. You can also contact support @ hackerrank.com for troubleshooting.</li>\n<li>If you find that a completed test contains a leaked question, you can choose to disregard the question while tabulating scores from the candidate's attempts.</li>\n<li>You can also consider modifying the problem statement (since that's mostly what the tool matches similar content for) so it's not extremely generic or readily available on the internet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note: </strong>The tool highlights whether or not a question is leaked and checks for leaked content everyday. The results are almost perfectly accurate, and HackerRank employs due diligence while dealing with 'leaked' content. You should do the same based on the nature of the question(s).</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA47XSJ7EWDAYGEPZT9PSE62\"><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">How HackerRank Works on Library Leakage Detection and Mitigation</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank aims to focus on hiring decisions based on skill. Developers can showcase their skills in a fair and equitable testing environment. The integrity of the questions that comprise these tests is critical for developers and employers to feel confident in their fairness and efficacy. </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HA47XSJ739E03TE8PEDB1AM5\"><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Understanding HackerRank's Leak Detection</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank has its own in-house tool that scrapes the internet to find potential leaks online. Questions that match a certain threshold are marked as leaked and hidden from the default library.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">How does this tool work?</span></strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\"><br></span><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">The tool performs an automated Google search of the Problem Statement. It returns a list of websites where it finds parts of the statement. Each URL is visited and scraped for its content. The matching unit consists of multiple string matching algorithms. Anything above a certain threshold of the matching score is considered leaked.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">How often is the leak detection run?</span></strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\"><br></span><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank runs this tool consistently, once everyday.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Are there any questions that are leaked but not flagged?</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">While HackerRank aims to have a very high accuracy of leakage detection, there could be instances of leakage that the system may not flag. Please feel free to report it </span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041328854-Report-a-Question-Leak-\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">here</span></a><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HA47XSJ79DGVTFA2KKTP37QV\"><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Understanding HackerRank's Mitigation<br></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Question leaks compromise the integrity of the test questions, thus making it difficult for companies to identify developers with the most vital technical skills. HackerRank ensures that the question integrity is maintained by monitoring and containing the leaked questions.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Web pages that, in reposting content, also infringe on the company’s logo and name.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">For-profit domains such as course or training websites that infringe HackerRank questions to drive transactions or user signups.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Online content that copies the default code stubs provided with each question. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">The United States copyright and DMCA laws protect content from HackerRank’s question library. This allows HackerRank to issue DMCA takedown notices where users or websites infringed on HackerRank's copyright in violation of the fair usage doctrine. A proactive DMCA policy is the best way to ensure that the assessments are a fair and effective way for developers to demonstrate their skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank's online leak detection system proactively identifies leaked questions to detect a possible leakage on the internet. Then, a manual review is performed for every detection on a case-by-case basis. HackerRank only sends a DMCA takedown notice when it has ensured the accuracy and considered how the decision impacts developer communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank’s DMCA takedowns follow a four-step process of identification, prioritization, manual review, and communication. </span><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/dmca-takedown-policy/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Read</span></a><span style=\"color: #091e42;\"> more on how HackerRank takes down leaked content from the web.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Identification:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank actively monitors for leaked content by using automation to detect infringing material.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank then records the domain, question ID, and question creation date of each flagged URL.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Prioritization:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank prioritizes its DMCA responses based on the severity of the breach and the type of domain, in addition to a range of other factors. The priority on the takedown of pages is done with one or more of the following characteristics:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Web pages that flagrantly post screenshots and a verbatim copy of question text of regularly used questions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank deprioritizes takedowns of pages created by developer communities that publish content and developer-created solutions for learning and educational purposes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Review:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank’s product content team conducts manual, in-house reviews of every flagged URL to ensure no false positives are made.<br></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Multiple reviewers assess each URL to ensure a fair and accurate review process.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">If a false positive is identified, the question is marked as not leaked, whitelist the URLs.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">If a case does violate HackerRank’s copyright and DMCA policy, the content is advanced to the next stage.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Communication:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank sends a DMCA notice to the online service provider if a page warrants a takedown.</span></li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #091e42;\">The notice will always contain the following:</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Why is the recipient receiving the notice</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">How to respond to the notice</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">The required response timeline </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">How to dispute a DMCA takedown</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA47XSJ7FA4JKHEQXPX34YJJ\">\n<span style=\"color: #091e42;\">HackerRank's Library Refresh</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">Based on the leakage, HackerRank backfills the library with questions each quarter to have a pool of questions for each skill. In the first three quarters of 2022, HackerRank added an average of 435 questions to the library each quarter (in the enterprise plan). These questions were across hands-on projects, SQL, and coding questions to address popular content requests from customers, backfilling to address leakage of questions from the HackerRank library, and refresh the library with new content across diverse skills.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #091e42;\">These additional questions enable customers to </span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009582313-Leaked-Questions-Indicator#replace-question-functionality\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">replace questions</span></a><span style=\"color: #091e42;\"> leaked in tests.</span></p>\n<p> </p>","title":"Managing Leaked Questions"}
