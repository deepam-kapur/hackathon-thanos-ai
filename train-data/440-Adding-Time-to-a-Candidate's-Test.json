This is because the machine for DevOps question purges after the test has been submitted. The candidate can be re-invited to take the test and must work on all questions as a new attempt. If time is added to such a test, the candidates will not be able to log in and start the test.</p>","title":"Adding Time to a Candidate's Test"}
