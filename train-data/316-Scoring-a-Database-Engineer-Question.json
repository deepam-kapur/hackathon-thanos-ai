The data retrieved by a candidate is compared to the correct answer. If they match, a full score is awarded to the candidates. However, if they do not match, then the candidate receives a zero score.

However, if you review their query it might be almost correct and seem worthy of the partial score. Therefore, it is a good idea to also manually evaluate the queries.</p>","title":"Scoring a Database Engineer Question"}
