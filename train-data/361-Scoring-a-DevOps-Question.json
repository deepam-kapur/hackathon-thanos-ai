You can assign full, partial, or zero points. The scoring logic of this script is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the check script prints one or more lines of output of the form “Partial Credit: &lt;value&gt;%,” then:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The percentages in all such lines are summed up to yield the percentage score of that question. Let us assume it is x%.</li>\n<li>The candidate's score is x% of the maximum score assigned to that question.</li>\n<li>If the Percentage(%) sign is missing, we assume it is a 100-normalized percentage, e.g., “Partial Credit: 50” is equivalent to “Partial Credit: 50%”.</li>\n<li>If a printed partial credit is less than 0%, it is ignored.</li>\n<li>If a printed partial credit is greater than 100%, it is considered 100%.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If the check script does <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">not</span> print any lines of output of the form “Partial Credit: &lt;value&gt;%”:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>And if the check script exits with a return value of 0, then 100% of the maximum score for that question is assigned.</li>\n<li>And if the check script exits with a non-zero return value, then 0 points are assigned to that question. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","title":"Scoring a DevOps Question"}
