The integrity of an assessment also relies on plagiarism detection.</p>\n<p>With the widespread availability of AI tools such as ChatGPT, there is a rising need for plagiarism strategies to ensure all developers get an opportunity to demonstrate their unique skill sets.</p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: The Plagiarism detection is available only for the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006421707-Creating-a-coding-question-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coding type questions</a> in HackerRank. </p>\n<h2 id=\"01H84FS1KJ3BPNPJNSST8V7HSJ\">Why AI-Powered Plagiarism Detection?</h2>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-5798d09f-7fff-e474-cc45-04c0e334e41b\">Code similarity has been the primary signal for plagiarism detection across the online coding assessment industry. The traditional code similarity-based approach caused a significant false positive rate of (70-80%) has been observed when coding questions tend to have limited solution patterns. This false positive rate requires more manual reviews by administrators. Therefore, the main goal of the AI-powered plagiarism solution is to decrease the false positive rate and protect candidates from being incorrectly flagged for plagiarism.</p>\n<p>Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are complex for a code similarity-based detection method because a new response could be generated for each user. The AI-powered solution will be able to flag such cases of cheating reliably.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01H84FS1KKH10NSH5XZ91J6SPP\">How HackerRank Detects Plagiarism with AI</h2>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-ad47e3a9-7fff-3f0e-e877-3953084c5185\">The new plagiarism detection system feeds several proctoring and user-generated signals into a supervised Machine Learning algorithm to flag suspicious behavior during an assessment. By understanding code iterations made by the candidate, the model can detect if they had external help, including from ChatGPT. The result is a solution with an AI-based plagiarism detection system with a 93% accuracy rate, dramatically reducing false positives from the traditional model.</p>\n<p>Besides reducing false positives, the new AI-powered model improves precision and recall over traditional Moss code similarity models.</p>\n<p>The table describes a comparison of the Precision and Recall values for the AI-powered and Moss Code similarity models:</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;
