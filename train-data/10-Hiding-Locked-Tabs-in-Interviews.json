This ensures that only the tabs you want the candidate to focus on are visible to the Candidates. You can now do this using the <strong>Automatic Tab Locking</strong> feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Locked and Untitled tabs will not be displayed to the candidate, irrespective of whether the feature is enabled or disabled.</p>\n<p>The Auto tab Lock feature is helpful for these reasons: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interviewers may not want Candidates who are not doing well to progress to further tabs. Therefore, the additional tabs on the Interviews should not be visible to the candidate.</li>\n<li>Candidates are not distracted by additional tabs, especially those that an Interviewer might use later in the interview.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HMXDX524NT0GYFHMFGJJ9STX\"><strong>Enable Automatic Tab Lock and Hide in Interview Settings</strong></h2>\n<p>You can enable this feature by navigating to the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007439768#settings\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Interview Settings</span></strong></a> page under<strong> Profile &gt; Settings.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Automatic Tab Lock</strong> feature is disabled by default.
