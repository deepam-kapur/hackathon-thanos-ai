In such a case, if you would want candidates to retake a specific test, you can send them an invite again without deleting the previous reports of invites and attempts. All attempts of candidates will be stored, and you can view the report for each test from a detailed report. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Once the test is completed, you can view the detailed report for every attempt.</span></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: You can invite a candidate only if you own a recruiter license. Hiring managers need to ask their recruiters to send invitations to the candidates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HAAQHX79NBY4JN3Z14PK9ZGS\">Steps to Reinvite the Candidates</h2>\n<p>You can visit here if you want to see the procedure to invite a candidate to a test.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Steps</span></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the Tests tab on the home page, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">then click the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">required test.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the <strong>Candidates</strong> option on the right pane, select the desired candidate name/s, and click the <strong>Invite Selected</strong> option. <img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/23685716847379\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also re-invite multiple candidates at once using the same procedure. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon clicking re-invite, you will be redirected to the <strong>Invite Candidates</strong> page, where the invites can be sent out. </li>\n</ol>","title":"Reinviting Candidates to a Test"}
