As of now, the available cohorts for benchmarking are -</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates within the same organization.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates across the </span><strong>HackerRank for Work </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance of Benchmarking</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a hiring manager, it is crucial to make hiring decisions that can be backed by data and this is where benchmarking comes in handy.

Thus, benchmarking enables hiring managers to make better screening decisions.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong>Interview Benchmarking </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- It is also possible to benchmark a candidate's Interview performance against the average rating given by an interviewer. It also helps you ensure a consistent benchmark across your interview panel. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<strong>Debrief Packet </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- The benchmarking feature provides additional information on a candidate’s performance including their scores in CodeScreen (assessment) and , benchmarked against a cohort of candidates who have been assessed on the same skill.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">View benchmarking inside Candidate Packet</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To view your candidate’s benchmarking data, open the Candidate Packet.
