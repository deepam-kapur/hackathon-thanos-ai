Across the board in organizations of all sizes. Mid-level candidates typically have 2-5 years of experience. The below visual shows a standard mid-level hiring process flow. In the following sections, we will go over these key differences. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4415711946643/Professional_Hiring__Mid-Level__January_2022.png\" alt=\"Professional_Hiring__Mid-Level__January_2022.png\"></p>\n<h2>Phase 1: Plan<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since mid-level talent is a more in-demand role,  this also means - they will have more opportunities available to them and therefore you may not have as many candidates. The planning phase is important because you will take on a slightly more calculated approach to the Interview process and the process should be a bit more hands-on than early talent. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subject matter experts will play a lesser role in the mid-level hires, although you may still want to engage 1 or 2 hiring managers to play the SME role. You will also want to have a pool of validators for the screening assessments in order to create a timeline for how long the validation and test process will take. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the planning phase is the time to:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide what is a must-have, nice to have, and what is not necessary. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narrow down the role and skills to more specifics than you would with early talent. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the time needed to customize emails and communication steps. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Phase 2: Screen</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike early talent, you may want to consider having a phone screen with your recruitment team, prior to sending out a screen challenge. Since the candidate pool will be smaller this is a great time to further refine the candidate list. It also allows the recruiter to explain the process.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Points to consider:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporate more real-world projects from the Library.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have fewer multiple-choice questions and include questions that show more advanced problem-solving skills that show off their work experience. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically these questions will be more in-depth and take the candidate 90-120 minutes to complete. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you will want to evaluate the candidate’s scores in order to analyze the candidate performance trends. This step will help you understand which candidates to further evaluate in a virtual onsite Interview session. </span></p>\n<p>The video below shows you how to send your test invitations, and how to evaluate results and feedback to move a candidate forward to the next stage.</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3); overflow: hidden; min-width: 320px;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://hackerrank.trainn.co/share/dc674b12-c727-4a9c-bb32-ab8242eaad77/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Phase 3: Interview<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have identified the top performers, it's time to start the interview round. With HackerRank Interview, you can keep the interview collaborative and interactive with video and chat capabilities. The fully functioning IDE allows candidates to show off their code or dive deeper into the thought process.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Interview, you can pull in the previous advanced question type or Project and use this time to discuss their approach to finding the answer or problem.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing this also shows the candidate that they actually had their submission reviewed and you are excited to review it with them. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch this short video to see how to use HackerRank Interview functionality. </span></p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3); overflow: hidden; min-width: 320px;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://hackerrank.trainn.co/share/2ae2b87a-7648-472f-a20f-86866e4b1798/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Phase 4: Rank</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a hiring manager, it is crucial to make hiring decisions that can be backed by data. Because some interviewers are more lenient, benchmarking can help make the final decision easier across multiple interviews. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HackerRank's Benchmarking compares a candidate's scores on specific skills against a cohort of candidates who have been assessed on the same set of skills.  Access real-time data on a candidate’s performance on the test and in the interview.  If you haven't already, it's a good time to discuss the protocol of where you want to review the candidate’s interview information. It can be reviewed in the HackerRank platform or ATS if you have the integration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The below video shows you how to use review candidates information within HackerRank</span></p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3); overflow: hidden; min-width: 320px;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://hackerrank.trainn.co/share/5b10b0db-67e4-48c3-81eb-c7cedeec2a40/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>","title":"Mid-Level"}
