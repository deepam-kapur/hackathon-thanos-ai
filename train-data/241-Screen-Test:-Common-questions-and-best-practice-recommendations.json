Below you’ll find essential questions with corresponding answers containing best practice recommendations.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What are the core/baseline skills the test should be assessing for?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On breaking down the Job Description, identify 2-3 </span><strong>must-have</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> skills needed for the job. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be fundamentals that are essential for the role, which the Hiring Manager expects one to be proficient in, before the technical interview. (such as Problem Solving, Language Proficiency, Databases, etc.)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Structure the test with practical scenarios for the must-have skills as the main focus, and add multiple choice questions for the nice-to-have skills.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Will the test reports be reviewed by any Hiring Managers?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A HackerRank test can be set up in a fully automated fashion to evaluate and assess candidates.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend that the Hiring Managers and their team create the assessment based on the evaluation criteria, leveraging the above point.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After performing benchmarking, the team can set a cut-off score which will automatically classify candidates as passed/failed.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above approach and setup offloads the evaluation to the HackerRank platform, thus not requiring attention to individual test reports by the Hiring Manager.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, they can still review and modify the score of a candidate as they see fit.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>What should I do when my test questions get leaked?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t assume just because a question is leaked suddenly everyone is going to get the answer correct. Many candidates do not look up answers during the assessment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check where the answer is leaked. A free site like Stack Overflow is different from a paid subscription where it’s a lot less likely a candidate will enroll mid-test to look up the answer.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a question is leaked, keep a close eye on the question scores going forward. If it starts to trend up then it’s a good sign to swap the question out.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, if multiple candidates are looking up the question and using the answer, the plagiarism flag will start to be triggered more frequently and you’ll know they looked up the solution.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A leaked question doesn’t necessarily mean the solution is online too. There are cases where the problem statement is leaked but there is no solution available. Hence, check the leakage source.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>What should the test set-up look like for a Software engineering role (Junior level)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally 2-3 coding questions of either increasing difficulty or spread across topics you’d like to assess (general coding, sql, basic linux, etc.)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple Choice questions can also be used to test a wider range of skills and help with coding fatigue when candidates already have done a few strenuous questions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max time should be between 60-90 minutes for a junior role. Closer to 60 is probably better to ensure a higher completion rate.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>How do I ensure that I get a 60% pass rate in my test?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuously monitor and adjust the test. If after the first 50 candidates there’s a 20% pass rate, look at question difficulty, test length, candidate feedback.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no set way to guarantee a 60% pass rate as every test and candidate pool is different. However, monitoring early test attempts closely and reacting quickly can ensure a 60% rate is reached. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write good test instructions and explain to the candidate what they should expect, what the test is about and why it is relevant. Good test instructions help to diminish the drop-off rate.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Why should I set a cut off score for my test? </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps ease the work of the employee assessing the candidates.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We highly recommend running enough tests before using a cut off.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once there’s sufficient data and you’ve seen only candidates who get above X score get sent to the next stage of the interview process, then you can set a cut off so no one has to waste time looking at tests with scores below that number.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>What should I benchmark my test?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no set percentage to benchmark to, but it’s important early on to keep tabs on all the candidates and their scores and decide various benchmarks.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you may have had 100 people take the test and sent them all to the next stage and saw that everyone who scored below a 50% was clearly not skilled enough. You can now set that 50% as a benchmark for pass/fail.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, you saw that anyone who scored above a 90% was extremely skilled and could qualify for a more senior role. You could set a benchmark for 50-90% pass and stick with the junior role, &gt;90% pass and see if they’re a good fit for a senior role.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>How do I know that my tests are comparable to my peers?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no right or wrong test format, but the HackerRank team can look at your test and give advice.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the HackerRank team can give you industry-wide numbers (such as average completion rate, pass rate, etc.) and you can see how the test compares to those and adjust accordingly.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>What are best practices to achieve global test assessment standardization?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qCi_N_W2ntnn2l-QyCMZYxSHbaGykZBHd2odkZc_c_8/edit#slide=id.g117562f3e62_0_9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standardization best practices deck here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>What are the factors to consider when benchmarking a test?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential to get feedback from your internal test takers on several key factors:</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test Duration - Not too short, not too lengthy.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Question Difficulty - On par with the standard set by new employees hired for the same position.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Question Relevance - Alignment with the Job Description, and correlation with skills evaluated with respect to the role &amp; experience level.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Question Type - Junior roles may require simple coding or MCQs but for senior folks, giving them a real world application development project makes more sense.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Can test instructions and invitations be customized?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, test instructions and invitations can be customized and branded to improve the candidate experience.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>How to create one test for different candidate pools (varying by experience level)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a mix of MCQs and simple coding questions for junior candidates.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to mid level and senior candidates, use project based questions (Frontend, Backend and fullstack framework specific application development questions), system design questions and code review questions. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In certain cases, skip the screen part and move on to the interviews platform directly for senior positions like tech lead, architects, SDMs and staff positions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>What are the best practices for proctoring the tests?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refer here - </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UersgTwSqedBPAsUzh2mMoHq-v3nJ2HSscDUWhugPWY/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proctoring Best Practices</span></a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Can I add my own questions to the test?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you can add your own content onto the platform.

This would apply for all the coding questions present in the test.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other way is to restrict it question wise. To do this, you can clone a question and edit the language options there. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note : A language will be enabled for a question only if it's enabled at a test level and at the question level.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>I want multiple tests with the same test settings and the majority of questions being the same; is this possible?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you can create one main test and have it as a template. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, different teams can view that and clone it and make small changes as needed.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also lock the main test so that other teams don't edit it.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Is there a simple guide available highlighting all the skills and questions to use for assessing niche roles?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can refer our skills directory for a quick brief about what skills and core competencies you can assess on the platform - </span><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-directory\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skills Directory</span></a>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from this, we also have detailed documents explaining the skills information, question types available to use, method of scoring and sample questions to use for a few roles as given below:</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data related roles - </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbtlD1_HzMhEgOwCmoYC02H0fI0DlNbZUKynGx8yBZs/edit?usp=sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document Link</span></a>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile roles (as of today) - </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L5LKn29PnkKQqiqLm_cxNl5zSkbX4q3vDPMYeNkfDwg/edit?usp=sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document Link</span></a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps and Cloud roles - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxrpcQlPvD4tFh_mnqhzE5NwdPC-gF4F4s6YTA1JYRA/edit?usp=sharing\">Document Link</a></span></p>","title":"Screen Test: Common questions and best practice recommendations"}
