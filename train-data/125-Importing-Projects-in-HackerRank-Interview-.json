With this feature, interviewers can assess candidates on skills such as React, Angular, Node, and so on, during live interviews. This article will walk you through the steps to import projects in HackerRank Interview.</p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note:</strong> This experience is valid only for Front-end, Back-end, and Full Stack questions.

This will take you to the <strong>Question Library </strong>(or) click on the <strong>Questions </strong>option from the left panel.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4407493962643/Question_library.jpg\" alt=\"Question_library.jpg\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Inside the library, select the desired question type from the Type drop-down menu, and click on <strong>Use </strong>to use that question.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4490617015827/image1.png\" alt=\"image1.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Here the IDE will be launched where you can collaborate with the candidate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the question is selected, it gets populated in the left-hand panel, and you will see the IDE on the right.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402954197907/image7.png\" alt=\"image7.png\"></p>\n<h3>Import from Tests to Interview</h3>\n<p>You can also import the candidate solution from a previous Code screen test of the candidate. Follow the below steps to do the same.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To import a question from the Candidates test, click on the plus (+) icon on the top.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the landing page, hover your mouse on the left pane.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here you can see the <strong>Candidate's Test, </strong>and you can find the questions used in the candidate's test. Click on <strong>Use</strong> to launch the question.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4490625592083/image7.png\" alt=\"image7.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can now ask the candidate to present the solution approach they took. You can also further build on the solution by working collaboratively.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Candidate Experience During the Interview</h2>\n<p>Once the candidate navigates to the Projects question imported by the interviewer, they will see the IDE based on VS Code. They can now explore the files, run the project, open the preview (applicable for front-end tasks), and solve it.</p>\n<h3>Pair Programming with Candidates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All participants will see a tab called \"Participant\" in the left-hand panel of the IDE menu. All the participants and the file they are on will be visible here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On clicking the filename, it will take one to the cursor position that the participant is in.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402962385811/image6.png\" alt=\"image6.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The same can be achieved by clicking on the participant's name on the top right corner of the screen where the participants' names are displayed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4490589345939/image5.png\" alt=\"image5.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, the participant position would be visible on the open file name inside the IDE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any file that a candidate opens will automatically be opened in the background for all interviewers, enabling them to observe which file the candidate is working on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402954160915/image4.png\" alt=\"image4.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>But files that an interviewer opens would not be automatically open for other participants, including the candidate in the Interview. This is done so that interviewers have autonomy in exploring the files and modifying them if needed. And while they are at it, the candidate is not distracted by new files opened automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can expand the Scorecard panel to record your evaluation of the candidate based on their solution.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4490629856147/image8.png\" alt=\"image8.png\"></p>\n<p>Here is a quick video to get you started importing a pair programming project in HackerRank.</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3); overflow: hidden; min-width: 290px;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://hackerrank.trainn.co/share/b41b33e9-a76f-4517-a9ea-f3ccd2055b13/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Viewing a candidate's solution in an Interview report</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As an interviewer, go to \"My Interviews\" inside the Interview tab of your profile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access the record of the candidate whose report you want to view.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the View Submission button to view the candidate's solution.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402954241427/image1.jpg\" alt=\"image1.jpg\"></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>","title":"Importing Projects in HackerRank Interview "}
