Therefore, the additional tabs on the Interviews should not be visible to the candidate.</li>\n<li>Candidates are not distracted by additional tabs, especially those that an Interviewer might use later in the interview.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HMXRF8F9WHSTPFHJ5BSZYPNB\">Enable Automatic Tab Lock and Hide in Interview Settings</h2>\n<p>You can enable this feature by navigating to the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007439768#settings\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Interview Settings</span></strong></a> page under<strong> Profile &gt; Settings.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Automatic Tab Lock</strong> feature is disabled by default.
