Not only do they help shape your company’s culture, but as they develop skills, they help drive the future development of your company’s road map. Early Talent usually consists of recent college graduates or developers with less than two years of hands-on, real-world experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HackerRank has put together the following best practices process for hiring early talent developers. From resume submission to onsite interview up to the final offer, HackerRank can help streamline this process so that your team is spending as much time as possible effectively evaluating the right skills for the role.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4415722609939/Early_Professional_Hiring_January_2022.png\" alt=\"Early_Professional_Hiring_January_2022.png\"></p>\n<h2>Phase 1: Plan </h2>\n<h4>Step 1: Define your hiring process</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the role can be promoted, Talent Acquisition, Hiring Managers, and Subject Matter Experts should all work together to define what the assessment and hiring process should work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factors to consider: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What role are you hiring for?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will they be an intern? Campus hiring? Or blast off to everyone?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can we reduce bias in our hiring process?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who will be your SME?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will there be an ATS integration for housing data? </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subject matter experts are vital in the planning stage. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These individuals are</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> typically experienced developers within the business. They could potentially be the hiring manager. As the SME, they ensure the most effective and efficient assessments/questions/processes are leveraged by your organization. This will be true for any role or experience level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An SME will help you:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Define a range of skills that you want to hire for</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide question randomization and cutoff scores</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Structure the processes in place for test validation</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Step 2: Identify your test validator</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, Identify your test validator. This individual is frequently a current employee that is at the same level as the role you are hiring. Create a timeline for how long the validation and test process will take. This will be a good time to send out calendar invites to secure deadlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also use this time to set up and</span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500008525861-Introducing-Interview-Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> create Interview Templates</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Before sending out the invites, it's a good idea to:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide what additional </span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000821808-Test-Settings-and-Configuration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">test settings</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to establish.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand the invitations and customized emails</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a cadence to review all the candidates that will be pushed into the phone screen with the hiring manager </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Step 3: Analyze candidate performance trends.</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have sent out your invitations and candidates have begun to submit tests, you will want to evaluate the candidate’s scores in order to analyze the Candidate performance trends. This step will help you understand which candidates to further evaluate for the initial phone screen with the recruiter. If the phone screen is a success, you will have the information needed to invite them in for a virtual onsite interview session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch the video below to see how HackerRank’s Screen platform makes sending invites as easy as a 3-step process.</span></p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3); overflow: hidden; min-width: 320px;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://hackerrank.trainn.co/share/dc674b12-c727-4a9c-bb32-ab8242eaad77/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Phase 3: Interview</h2>\n<h4>Step 1: Setup your Interview</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s time to interview your top candidates. Now is a great time to get aligned with other interviewers. A consistent interview process reduces bias while also providing a way to benchmark and compare candidates to get the right fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable a consistent and structured interview process with our </span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500008525861-Introducing-Interview-Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interview Templates</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's important that interviewers ask the same or similar set of questions to every candidate applying for a role. These templates ensure that each interviewer is asking the candidate the right questions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few questions to consider: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does the candidate react when they’re given a problem they’ve never seen?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you allowing room for diversity in the approach to the problem? How many ways can you solve it?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also created </span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049354333-Recommended-Questions-and-Interviewer-s-Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interview Guidelines</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that provide recommended questions, curated specifically for interviews, that take less than 30 mins to solve.

If you haven't already, it's a good time to discuss the protocol of where you want to review the candidate's interview information. Will you review in HackerRank or within the ATS if you have integrated one? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HackerRanks </span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000085041-Benchmarking-inside-Candidate-Packet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benchmarking</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compares a candidate's scores on specific skills against a cohort of candidates who have been assessed on the same set of skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The below video shows you how to use review candidate's information within HackerRank.</span></p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3); overflow: hidden; min-width: 320px;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://hackerrank.trainn.co/share/5b10b0db-67e4-48c3-81eb-c7cedeec2a40/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>","title":"Early Talent "}
