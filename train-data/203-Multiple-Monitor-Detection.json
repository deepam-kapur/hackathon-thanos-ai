You may want to know if a candidate is using an external monitor to cheat during their assessments. This can be a significant indicator while making a decision on a candidate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HJVRXXGY2NB8EPDEXYXDKS9G\">Engaging Multiple Monitor Detection on a Test</h2>\n<p>From the <strong>Test Integrity </strong>settings of a test, within the <strong>Proctoring </strong>area, you’ll see Multiple Monitor Detection.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong><img style=\"height: 333px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/24631167808147\"></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HJVRXXGYPMEQNGXZPCXY3WBK\">Candidate Experience</h2>\n<p>When engaged, if the candidate is using another browser, they will see a browser recommendation.</p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 267px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/24631167819539\"></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>:</strong> HackerRank will not flag the candidate if they proceed; this is a recommendation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5\">Before a candidate starts the test, they will be prompted to allow HackerRank the ability to manage all of the windows across the monitors a candidate is using. During the login process of the candidate, HackerRank will capture the number of monitors a candidate is using. Then, changes in the number of monitors will be detected.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5 wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><img style=\"height: 400px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/24631137082771\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5\">If a candidate tries to remove the <strong>Window management</strong> access during their test attempt, they will be shown the following alert message. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5 wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><img style=\"height: 192px; width: 624px;\" src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/24631137103379\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5 wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Candidates can continue their attempt by resetting the window management settings and refreshing the page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HJVRXXGYCJZHP40DAM8F833P\">Monitor Detection log available within test reports</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5\">From the <strong>Timeline </strong>tab of the candidate report, you’ll then be able to view the list of events, such as changes in the number of windows open throughout the duration of the test.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5 wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/24631167780499\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent0.5 wysiwyg-text-align-left\">HackerRank is also adding an additional column in the Excel report called ‘<strong>Max number of monitors detected</strong>,’ which will show the count of monitors that were connected throughout the duration of a candidate attempt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HJVRXXGY42RVF0Q8MHNFC1V4\">Key Takeaway </h2>\n<p>Multiple monitor detection is designed to be used as an additional indicator of candidate behavior while engaging in a test. It should not be used as the only indicator used to flag candidates for dishonest behaviors. This feature, along with <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011479133-Proctoring-HackerRank-Tests\" target=\"_self\">proctoring test settings</a> such as copy-paste tracking, tab proctoring, image proctoring, <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/16146609166483-AI-Powered-Plagiarism-Detection\" target=\"_self\">AI-powered plagiarism detection</a>, and more, can be used to aid the process of reviewing candidates and flagging those engaging in dishonest behavior.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>","title":"Multiple Monitor Detection"}
