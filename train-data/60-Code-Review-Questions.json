This task is ideal for more senior-level candidates who are expected to have existing industry experience. They may be managers, mentors, or simply contributing members of a high-performing team.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Code Review questions are manually graded, as there is no automated way to read the feedback or judge their seniority.
