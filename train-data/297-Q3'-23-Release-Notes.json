We’ve rolled out a series of new improvements and fixes this October 2023. On request, our team is ready to assist you with the required change management. Please contact us at </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">support@hackerrank.com</span><span> if you have any questions.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HDJHN824QJAAK1K1X6PP8JB4\">Admin</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HDJHN824PJPJWN986Q5Q4W6A\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Centralized Test Settings for Uniformity in Tests</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Your test administrators will soon have the ability to set defaults that apply to all of your tests. For example, if you'd like all your tests to have plagiarism detection enabled or to have a set of fields that need to be collected, it can be enforced from a central location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The defaults work both ways. You can also ensure that none of your tests have a specific setting. Say, you don't want any of the tests to have video proctoring on, you can disable video proctoring across your tests too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">If company administrators lock a setting, only they can modify it. When a setting is unlocked, its value becomes the default, and users can adjust it for individual tests. If a setting is locked, its value is applied to all tests—including existing ones and individual users can not modify it for their tests. Any new tests, or older tests using the HackerRank default, will adopt these default settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">This update helps ensure that you are running a fully compliant organization. If you have more questions about specific settings and what each of the defaults does, please reach out to your customer account manager.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">To access centralized test settings, you will click on your profile in the top right corner, click settings, and then click test settings in the left panel. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/22478858105747\" alt=\"Untitled.png\"></p>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/22181498897683-Centralized-Test-Settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Centralized Test Settings </a>article to learn more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HDJHN824Q14AM79MYQ16QBD2\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">New User Management Page for Bulk Updates</span></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The new team management system will introduce an easier to use UI while providing additional filters and actions that simplifies bulk user management. A new filter by activity feature will help company admins ensure they have unused licenses that can be reallocated. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\"></span><span>Team admins are now team-specific rather than global. As a user, they can belong to multiple teams but they will have admin rights only for the teams to which they are assigned as a team admin. Flexible new role scoping enables precise access control across teams.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The import and export format of users has also been updated to accommodate these changes.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\"><br></span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">You will also have the ability to make bulk updates to your users, search through your list of users, and filter users. For example, if you want to activate or change the license type of multiple users at one time, you can do so with bulk updates. In addition, if you want to view all of your recruiter or developer users, you will have the ability to do that with new filters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Once live, you can navigate to your user management page to make bulk changes.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 446px; width: 602px;\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uOUeSLoPcwfQgeFceuBki-Ui7EO1uHObB0ggUulpS6zww_4n3Ao9rRoxrrcXH5dLogGudTGnx8J3RvjS7UC6Tc-xXFYZ44w6UUuqJeG4gbarzH_cyZmwzZdCzylysgESQaxzeB9dgoaTKaWFiXi20io\"></p>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/22181635545875-Teams-Management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Teams Management </a>article to learn more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HDJHN824VFJ7X2X1BMJZGYYD\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Improved Sharing Controls for Tests and Questions</span></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Previously, tests and questions could be accessed by all the teams across the company automatically. With the new explicit (manual) sharing controls, administrators will have the opportunity to disable the old method for sharing tests and questions. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Currently, when a user creates a test or a question, the resource is shared automatically with all users in teams the creator is a part of. Earlier this year, we introduced a new sharing system that allows owners/creators of a test, question, and interview template to specifically choose which users, teams, or if they would like everyone, to grant access to those resources with different permissions levels.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><br>This new feature will disable the automated team based access and allow for greater controls on access to individual resources. This is a one way option, if you enable this feature, you will not be able to re-enable team based sharing. If you activate this feature, then all newly created tests, questions, or interview templates that are created will only be available to the creator and company admins unless shared to others.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Visit the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/22181705964179-Disabling-Implicit-Sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Disabling Implicit Sharing </a>article to learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HDJHN824N2XCA21Q3G6D8CGV\">Integrations</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HDJHN8244RGMM5QHBM260558\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Logs for ATS Integrations</span></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">You will soon have the ability to view a record of integration activity between HackerRank and your ATS in the HackerRank platform. You will be able to get log results for a custom date range for any ATS integrated with your HackerRank instance and download a PDF report.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">For instance, if you want to see why something might not have synced correctly with your ATS from HackerRank, you can view a detailed log of the error with a timestamp and summary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">To access integration logs, you will click on your profile in the top right corner, click settings, and then click integrations in the left panel. </span></p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 297px; width: 593px;\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OJA2epytQYbV_lFJjupXz5h-JbWBySStsnoRoXy1evmY0yEOaIY446QIV-f5O5buTaRRM4KI0eVAPScvfeXARX8vuogmArZ8aZel_fs8v36LfCD28-EbX4t1mnz07So0q800GRIYXS0nTV7UiuI33y0\"></p>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/21774549534867-Integration-Logs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Integration Logs</a> article to learn more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HDJHN824BXNW2WVBMK86SPKE\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Enhanced Integration With iCIMS </span></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The iCIMS integration with HackerRank has been revamped with improved performance and greater functionality. For example, if you want to assign HackerRank tests and receive results without leaving your ATS, you can do so within iCIMS. This enhanced functionality enables you to do more without having to switch between HackerRank and iCIMS. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Visit the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/11720157490835-iCIMS-HackerRank-Integration-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iCIMS - HackerRank Integration Guide</a> to learn more.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HDJHN825W2SNE18EXW60YQZW\">Reporting</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HDJHN825CYHS1N6BG1939YRC\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Improved Filters for Candidate List and New Summary Reports</span></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">You will be able to better refine candidate search results with the help of optimized filters. Plus, you will have the ability to apply custom filters to better sort through candidates and find the right candidate for your roles. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">In addition, the summary reports page has been revamped with a new layout that shows the performance of the candidate along with that candidate’s activity during the attempt.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">For instance, if you want to create a list of candidates that showed signs of plagiarism, like copy-paste events, or that performed well, like scoring high on a specific skill, you can do so with these new filters. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">If you want to view how a candidate performed on each question and also view whether they displayed signs of plagiarism for those questions, you can do that from the new summary reports page.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Visit the <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408913281427-Viewing-a-Candidate-s-Test-Summary-Report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summary Reports</a> article to learn more.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 278px; width: 562px;\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lUHsop8RWkU5538vSxDPguR98QOT-O2jPBBPYhNBFstb2cDkOpgQO_gL33bZQYqhx54M_w-LMbINrxXI-3XUlo3oaCtEhWtFb_dgnSBTKGWR7D5dPdvql5pxRqULAiRpkiwBi6hsDbzWsqv8xtLNKFk\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HC1ST2R1BZSRGEQ4W4DSPCFD\">\n<br><br>\n</h1>","title":"Q3' 23 Release Notes"}
