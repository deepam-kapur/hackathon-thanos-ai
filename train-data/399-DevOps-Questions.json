When a candidate takes a test comprising DevOps questions, we set up their own sandbox Linux virtual machine to log in remotely. You can ask them to perform whatever tasks you like: install a package, create a file with certain contents, or perform an action with a specific tool like grep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can write a script to score candidates' performance or rely on the session playback to grade the test subjectively. The video playback feature lets you view if a candidate checked a manpage or knew how a tool worked from memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a DevOps question is present in a test, the HackerRank Test interface automatically setups the environment for the candidate. It gives an in-browser terminal where the candidates can answer their questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn how to create and score a DevOps question here:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006691787-Creating-a-DevOps-question\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a DevOps Question</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/219879848-Scoring-a-DevOps-question\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scoring a DevOps Question</a></li>\n</ol>","title":"DevOps Questions"}
