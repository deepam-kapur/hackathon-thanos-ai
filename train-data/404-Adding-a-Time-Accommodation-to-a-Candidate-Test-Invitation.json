Most of these settings are created by you while creating the test initially. We prioritize candidate experience to the highest degree, and to that standard, you can now specially tailor the test duration for candidates who need it. This applies to and includes candidates with visual impairments, disabilities, and other special needs. Providing deserving candidates extra time promotes inclusivity and rids discrimination on any grounds. </p>\n<p>Additionally, under special circumstances such as network outages, erroneous questions, or other issues, you might find it necessary to add extra time to all or some specific candidates' test attempts.</p>\n<p>You can now achieve the same with our '<strong>Time Accommodation</strong>' feature, which you will find on the Test Invite page.</p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: Extra time to specific candidates can only be allotted while inviting or reinviting the said candidate(s) to the test, and not when the test is ongoing. To add time to test attempts during an ongoing test, you will need to change the overall test duration, as explained <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000098448-General-settings-for-a-Test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01H8CXP8MZYFWGR8WRA051WVYM\">Steps to Add Extra Time to Test Attempts</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must be logged in to your HackerRank for Work account.</li>\n<li>You must have created and published the said test, and have access to the test. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Tests</strong> tab on the home page, and then click <strong>I<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">nvite</span></strong><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">. <br>Learn more about best practices for test invitations <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010645833-Inviting-Candidates-to-a-Test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. </span>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Clicking on the <strong>Invite </strong>option takes you to the <strong>Send Test Invites</strong> page. On it is displayed the email editor which lets you customize the invite and configure necessary settings. These settings are specific to every email invite. On the top right of the editor, you can see the <strong>Time Accommodation</strong> button. <img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/19773577952403\"></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">The Time Accommodation button comes with a percentage option, indicating what percent of the total time allocated you want to increase the attempt by. You can choose from 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, or even set a custom time increase percentage. For example, choosing 10% time accommodation in a test of 60 minutes time duration will now give the candidate 66 minutes to solve the test. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Once you have modified the time allocated, you will see the same in the invite template, as shown below. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402602541715\" alt=\"Time_Accomodation_-_Custom.jpg\" width=\"313\" height=\"330\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: Custom percentage add-ons need to be in multiples of five.</p>\n<p>Using this feature, you can easily modify a candidate's total time to solve a test. If you want to modify time for multiple candidates and send the test invite, you can do so by bulk-uploading candidates.
