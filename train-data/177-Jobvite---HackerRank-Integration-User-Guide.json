The first time HackerRank sends results to Jobvite is at the end of the test once the report is generated. After that, any user action in HackerRank for Work that changes the candidate report will be synched back to Jobvite. The significant visible changes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A change in the candidate's score</li>\n<li>A change in the status of the test report - for example, from Completed - Evaluation Required to Completed - Failed.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><button class=\"accordion\">I moved a candidate to the HackerRank Assessment state, but the candidate has not yet received the email. Why?</button></p>\n<div class=\"panel\">\n<p>The HackerRank servers pull the Jobvite servers once in every 60 minutes. Therefore, it can take an hour for the candidate to receive the invitation email.</p>\n</div>\n<p><button class=\"accordion\">Who is treated as the inviting recruiter if invited through Jobvite?</button></p>\n<div class=\"panel\">\n<p>The owner or creator of the test is treated as the recruiter inviting the candidate.</p>\n</div>\n<p><button class=\"accordion\">Can I use a custom template that is saved on HackerRank?</button></p>\n<div class=\"panel\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">You cannot save a custom template to be sent to the candidate.Â The HackerRank for Work default template is used.</span></p>\n</div>","title":"Jobvite - HackerRank Integration User Guide"}
