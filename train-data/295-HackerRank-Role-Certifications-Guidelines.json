Role Certifications use HackerRank’s Skills Taxonomy as the basis for determining the specific skills associated with each role. HackerRank Role Certifications provide verification of skills proficiency associated with a specific role, they do not imply a guarantee or endorsement of a developer for employment decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRYXQNEYE41HTP6P6ANJNSQR\">Role Certifications details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Role Certifications consist of a specific set of skill assessments using valid HackerRank assessments. \n<ul>\n<li>Learn more about the process we’ve used to develop valid, fair and reliable HackerRank’s skills assessments <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/26279861944979-Manual-for-Fair-Hiring\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">here </span></a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>HackerRank identifies the skills associated with specific roles based on our Skill Taxonomy.

No guarantee is made that HackerRank Assessments will align exactly with your proprietary skills taxonomy and may require modification to match the skills requirements for roles at your organization. </li>\n<li>Passing cut-scores are set by default to a score generated by HackerRank that is based on our benchmarking data. This threshold is an approximation of the 75th percentile score for a sampling of questions assessing the same skill at the same difficulty level. \n<ul>\n<li>Cut-scores may require adjustments by company based on organizational requirements, employee knowledge levels, and other company-specific differences. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Role Certifications do not holistically evaluate non-technical skills and are set by default to assess technical skills identified by HackerRank’s research. Therefore, other non-technical assessments for employees may be required for a holistic view of candidate skills. </li>\n<li>Role Certifications are intended to enhance, not replace, your current learning &amp; development (L&amp;D), and internal mobility practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note: </strong>As you use Role Certifications, please provide ongoing feedback to HackerRank directly with your HackerRank Customer Account Manager.  Your input helps HackerRank continuously improve our solutions and ensure we meet your evolving needs.</p>","title":"HackerRank Role Certifications Guidelines"}
