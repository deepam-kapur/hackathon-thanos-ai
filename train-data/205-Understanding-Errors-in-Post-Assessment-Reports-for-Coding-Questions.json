This is a common error with a few ways to fix it, and the candidate would see the “ValueError” in the test cases during their assessment, which lets them know the test case isn’t passing and it’s due to this error which they have to fix.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><img style=\"height: 346px; width: 708px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0wmj_wzYnj6j14KWvokDBFpkWaC5ODm3esSutIIrsh0hlenZqcVd28ovldbxcHNWgnNEvmpRqqi2M7-AJD3nowZVJDcTYzbXfGxgVDXWL1P87cfNFioa3X_uXQ4PWRqgn0WbOCGJzgUxwwZj8W-HqXc\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">The second example says the function \"get_command_results\" is expecting two specific arguments, but the candidate's code hasn't passed them into the function, so the code cannot run. Similar to the above, the candidate would be aware of this during the test and should take the proper steps to fix the errors.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><img style=\"height: 386px; width: 706px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u9Ju4SIovJzrgM8Ba32uUH6oaSjs2VJYoJcOIBPW692t2BE7O-GOG5LxFea6WCztGm1gDSOZ3AVNPzmEoxLh43layrB8BVDYJSXJ0m-rKhcnc9AdjOcWPyd1qA-9Y9wZ3Kpr_zdrYdoO-1ccsiaELIU\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"> </p>","title":"Understanding Errors in Post-Assessment Reports for Coding Questions"}
