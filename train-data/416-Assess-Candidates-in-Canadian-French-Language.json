However, this requires that the assessments be in the preferred language of candidates. With this capability, the companies can rest assured that the candidates would be assessed solely on their skills.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Select the Candidate Facing Language</span></h2>\n<p><span>A candidate language is defined as a language in which the candidate wants to take the test. This includes the emails that a candidate receives, the login screen, and the editor experience. </span></p>\n<p><span>To enable this, HackerRank provides the companies with the ability to select the ‘<strong>Candidate Facing Language</strong>’ when sending out a test. </span></p>\n<p><span>This can be selected under the ‘<strong>General</strong>’ tab of the test settings page, as shown below.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/17634196680211\" alt=\"Test\"></p>\n<p><span>Once a test is created and published in a specific ‘Candidate Facing Language’ by the test creator, it is recommended not to change the ‘Candidate Facing Language’ for the same test.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Candidate Facing Changes to Review</span></h3>\n<p><span>Once the language is changed in the ‘<strong>General</strong>’ settings, the system will automatically change the candidate-facing strings under the <em>Candidates </em>and <em>Email</em><em> </em>tabs of Test Administration (shown below).</span><span></span></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><span><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that only default text will be translated upon changing the ‘Candidate Facing Language’ in all the sections. Any custom text that is added in place of the default text or in addition to the default text will not be translated even upon changing the ‘Candidate Facing Language’.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li><span>Review the following sections under the ‘<strong>Candidates</strong>’ tab</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Candidate details fields</span></li>\n<li><span>Disclaimer text</span></li>\n<li><span>Instructions text</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/17634799419795\" alt=\"Candidates\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><span>Review the following sections under the ‘<strong>Email</strong>’ tab</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Reminder emails</span></li>\n<li><span>Confirmation email</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/17634821266835\" alt=\"Emails\"></p>\n<p><span>Once these are verified, invite the candidates to the test.
