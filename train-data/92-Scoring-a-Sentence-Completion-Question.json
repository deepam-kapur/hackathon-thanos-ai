Sentence completion questions are \"fill in the blank\" questions. The answers are not case-sensitive. <em>For example</em>: if the correct answer is HTML, then HTML, Html, html, or HTml are all acceptable.</p>\n<p>To evaluate the score for a question, the fraction of correctly answered blanks to the total number of blanks is multiplied by the total score for the question.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br>The score for a question is 3, and there are three blanks in a question. <br>The candidate fills in two of these blanks correctly. <br>The fraction is ⅔; therefore, the final score is (2/3)*3, equal to 2.<em><br></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","title":"Scoring a Sentence Completion Question"}
