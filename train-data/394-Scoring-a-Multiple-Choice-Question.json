While creating a question, the question setter marks the correct answer. Later, candidates' responses are compared to the correct answer for scoring the question during automatic evaluation.</p>\n<p>You can assign a total score to an MCQ question while creating it. If there is more than one correct answer for a question, each correct answer is assigned an equal fraction of the total score. </p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: No point is assigned if a candidate selects more answer options than the number of correct answer options.</p>\n<p><em>Example</em></p>\n<table width=\"754\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A multiple-choice question is assigned 5 points. There are two correct options. Therefore, each option is for 2.5 points. If a candidate selects only one correct option, then the candidate gets only 2.5 points. However, if a candidate selects more than two options, then the candidate receives zero points.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can customize the score for each question while creating a question. You can also change the score for the complete test with multiple-choice questions from the MCQ settings located in advanced settings. In that case, the score you set at the test level will override the score assigned to each of the MCQ questions present in the test.</p>\n<p>The MCQ settings also allow you to assign a negative score for the incorrect answers. You can set a score for both correct and wrong answers. Negative marking for wrong answers ensures that candidates do not indulge in guessing the answers. </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<table style=\"height: 5px;\" width=\"712\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 708.011px;\">Suppose you assign a score of -1 for each wrong answer. Each time a candidate selects a wrong answer, the score is deducted by 1 point.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> The following example illustrates a case when there are multiple correct answers for a question with negative marking:</p>\n<p>Suppose a multiple choice question is assigned 5 points for a correct answer and -1 for a wrong answer. This question has two correct answers: A and C.</p>\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"height: 912px; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 67px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 153px; height: 67px;\">Candidate's Answer</td>\n<td style=\"width: 172px; height: 67px;\">Assigned score</td>\n<td style=\"width: 142.744px; height: 67px;\">Explanation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 43px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 153px; height: 43px;\">A &amp; C (Both correct choices)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 172px; height: 43px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 142.744px; height: 43px;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 96px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 153px; height: 96px;\">A &amp; B (One correct choice)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 172px; height: 96px;\">2.5+(-1/2)=2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 142.744px; height: 96px;\">Each correct answer earns 5/2=2.5 points.
