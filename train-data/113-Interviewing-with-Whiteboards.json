Hiring managers have found the whiteboard to be an effective tool for evaluating a candidate in the following aspects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>System design skills</li>\n<li>Presentation skills</li>\n<li>On-spot thinking and communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This article will give you a brief idea about whiteboards in interviews and their key features. </p>\n<h2>Whiteboard in Interviews</h2>\n<p>We have integrated a collaborative whiteboard inside our interviewing platform to elevate and align the remote interviewing experience with conventional onsite interviews.</p>\n<p>HackerRank’s remote technical interviewing solution helps organizations conduct compelling technical interviews anytime, anywhere, in a real, interactive coding environment. Learn more about how to conduct interviews using the HackerRank platform <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001806868-Interviews\"><span style=\"color: #097bbf;\">here</span></a>.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of the Whiteboard</h2>\n<p>The virtual whiteboard tool lets candidates and interviewers sketch diagrams using easy tools from the toolbar.</p>\n<p>Here are some key highlights of the virtual whiteboard inside a HackerRank Interview.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic Shapes and Text: The toolbar on the whiteboard hosts several commonly used shapes and text. You can choose a shape to draw by clicking on them or using their keyboard shortcut. The relevant keyboard shortcut is written below each available shape.</li>\n<li>Freehand tool: Candidates can also use the freehand option available in the toolbar to quickly sketch their thoughts on a data structure or an algorithm in a coding interview<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wR3_XKRbVtfg6ULifpV7w9IAKx_wDQKUVWP__PJRJyyuLa4jVtVNCLXn8tMvKcTwGCZdhjmvFrAgg7GfUMNqacV2FdgbxYAGztfUw92Y81NfnDl8CaQJfwZpk2OEMekcSk2qVskNEdUai7HWwTp6u4U\" alt=\"wb1_intw.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Working with Shapes: You can select either one shape or all shapes and move or delete them together. Use the Delete key from your keyboard after selecting a shape to delete it. You can also select and resize or rotate a shape if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborative Experience: All participants present in the interview, at a time, can see the real-time cursor position of the others in the interview along with their names. <img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tkJF7stLDalNCzDCwesQx2o8OMPDxgaeG-tI9iKyYV15J3ID8ZYB_fxTmXyOzKlrYOp17gM_5gHg2GA8uiQeC-lPmMMJbZBH9IizBj4jExEWbiKLQYpPSXd2CJ7XDQaln6gxk07TXjPXb-6tqoqQ_Fw\" alt=\"wb2_intw.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Infinite Space: The virtual whiteboard removes the space limitation of a physical board at an onsite interview. It is an infinite space where you can scroll the existing content of the board up and continue with your sketch. Use the + and - icons at the bottom of your whiteboard to zoom in or out of the board.<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_TVxfBSPzYwFCpT6fUY5vIwFI5remEzNvRJGxy3AbqaJFiBtDj0X1ELTJKG3yquzEhLFVXr1G1Ftym42bvPSvFRJpUVBC10ZSmOhVg0u0E878CVVmuTnZ4O_q5h756osCJ8VFae4kPht1Fe3Er0xDCk\" alt=\"gif2.gif\">\n</li>\n<li>Images: You can upload predefined architecture images to the whiteboard during the interview. You can also save whiteboard questions with images of the architecture to enhance the whiteboard interview process. Therefore the candidates need not have to sketch an architecture to replicate an architecture stored in an image format of their company. <img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1-MV9fvgMXyNmEpjTGTPLoBonsFfQsZwXtdGPmzaXFuV1vDoauqLRN8ZPuLprf40oxdKeXiUAeEDEIcd_LVdDvboTwc1OrdH3sAHbd1mIboNlf40P0EUKxa2PGCYGtVt2R0vxeeqB4iNoZh2EC0s4G8\" alt=\"wb3.png\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rK0yD7q7cFrzR21__XWcAyBtvIz-fs_T9-SsQfcxMdbffM1eFfb_ELlZZf90pU3TeZBjXphW32M8DbODSdSYpRG0ZNTyskNngw6L2WTBOq_M7QtCNNRMNWOV6pXW11fnzLpBKIIlv-25W0FY0wHqTf4\" alt=\"wb_image.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Start a Whiteboard in an Interview.</h2>\n<p>When you join an Interview, you will see the onboarding page.
