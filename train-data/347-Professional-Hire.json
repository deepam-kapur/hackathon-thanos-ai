These individuals have between 5-8 years of professional experience. Professional or Senior level talent is often a more passive candidate. In many cases, they are sourced through a referral internally. Additionally, many senior-level individuals are already employed and you will find that there are fewer candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The below visual shows a typical, senior-level hiring process flow. In the following sections, we will go over key differences in hiring this level of talent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4415711968275/Professional_Hiring__Experienced__January_2022.png\" alt=\"Professional_Hiring__Experienced__January_2022.png\"></span></p>\n<h2>Phase 1: Plan<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When planning to hire senior-level talent, the process will need to be more collaborative. It’s important that you get everyone on the same page about what the process will look like. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide as a team:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What experience level are you looking for? Sr. Manager, Lead, Director, VP, etc. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they need to have strong domain experience and knowledge?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What ideal personality traits would be a good culture fit for the team </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will this be a panel-style interview?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the review process for making a decision?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many times a senior-level candidate will never receive a test. This will need to be decided upfront and may vary from candidate to candidate and from role to role.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<h2>Phase 2: Screen<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas early-talent and mid-level candidates will be given a multiple-choice or real-world project, as mentioned above Senior-level talent will not. Typically, the best practice during the screening phase will simply be a phone discussion with the hiring manager.  Since they are most likely sourced or referred there may need to be less upfront validation. Experience speaks for itself. This is also a great opportunity for the hiring manager to SELL your company and team to the candidate.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use this time with the candidate to talk about:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidate’s experience. </span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some projects that they were excited to work on?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What made the project successful?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What kind of projects would they like to work on in the future?</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovative projects that the company is working on.</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will this role impact that project?</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This screening is a chance for you to get a feel for the candidate and their interest. If there is a mutual interest, now is a good time to let them know that they will be invited to a virtual onsite interview. Set the expectations with them of what they can expect for the in-person interview. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the interview, get the interview panel together again to re-align on the in-person interview. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<h2>Phase 3: Interview</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interview phase will typically include a few interviewers. The beginning of the interview is usually the best time to ask behavioral questions to identify if the candidate is a good culture fit for the company.  These questions should have been identified in the Plan phase of the hiring process. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next half of the interview is more technical in nature. For a Senior-level role, you will want to avoid multiple-choice questions. The goal here is to have them showcase their problem-solving skills and their ability to build or fix a real-world application. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have them showcase this by using a Whiteboard Interview question type, or have them work up an architectural Diagram within the interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch this short video to see how HackerRank Interview functionality can help. </span></p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(63,58,79,.3); overflow: hidden; min-width: 320px;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://hackerrank.trainn.co/share/2ae2b87a-7648-472f-a20f-86866e4b1798/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Phase 4: Rank<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to making a final decision on a candidate, the process will rely mostly on the importance of feedback from the interviewers and the consensus from the entire hiring team.
