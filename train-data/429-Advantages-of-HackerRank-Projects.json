The platform currently supports questions for Jupyter, Angular, React.JS, Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, and Java. While the previous environment supported tests for screening candidates on their core computer science skills, this environment enables you to evaluate candidates on project-based real-world problems. When hiring experienced candidates, companies often want to test their knowledge of frameworks and skills in building real applications. These skills can now be assessed through our project-based tests.</p>\n<p>The project-based environment facilitates hiring developers who are familiar with each layer of software technology and are adept at front-end programming, back-end programming, Full-stack development, DevOps, Data Science, and databases.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Advantages of the Project-based Testing Environment for Recruiters</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<p><strong>Automatic scoring and faster candidate evaluation</strong></p>\nThe 'HackerRank Projects testing environment supports<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> automatic scoring based on the number of unit test cases passed. It also supports any custom scoring method defined by the question setter. Candidate submission can be viewed in the Reports section.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>\nThe 'HackerRank Projects' testing environment can run any stack that is supported on Ubuntu. T<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his allows the question setter to upload a project directory and present candidates with a project initialized in the online IDE. Currently, our system supports project-based questions for front-end, back-end, and full-stack roles.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><br></span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<p><strong>Evaluates multiple candidates in parallel<br></strong></p>\nThe evaluation of front-end, back-end, and full-stack questions uses J-unit test cases or a custom scoring method. Both of these methods evaluate the candidates automatically. This allows simultaneous evaluation of multiple candidates. Hence, evaluation is both cost-effective and time-efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Advantages</span> of the HackerRank Projects Testing Environment for Candidates</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dedicated online IDE<br></strong></span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before launching our online IDE, candidates would have to understand the question setter's intent and locally set up a coding environment before getting started with the actual task. However, with the introduction of our new web-based IDE, the coding environment is pre-setup, which the candidates can use ready to solve the task. Our IDE allows candidates to code, create and move folders and files, and run project-type problems with access to a terminal.<br></span>Refer to the <a href=\"https://candidatesupport.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402921107091-Taking-Front-end-Back-end-Full-stack-developer-assessments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Taking Front-end, Back-end, Full-Stack Developer assessments</a> section to know how candidates can use the IDE in Tests.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402275298067/stopping_share.jpg\" alt=\"stopping_share.jpg\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Objective evaluation of the candidates</strong></p>\nThe project-based questions are evaluated objectively using J-unit testing or custom scoring, unlike subjective tests that are evaluated manually.
