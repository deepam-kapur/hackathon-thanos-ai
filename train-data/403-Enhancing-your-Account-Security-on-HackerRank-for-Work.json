In this article, we will discuss the important points to be noted to keep your account secure. </span></p>\n<h2>Key Points to Keep your Account Secure</h2>\n<h3>Create a Strong Password for your Account</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend using a strong password for your new HackerRank account. Some key points to remember while setting up your account password:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a <strong>combination of alphanumeric characters</strong> in your password</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure to maintain a <strong>minimum of 8 characters</strong> while setting your password</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use at least <strong>one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, </strong>and<strong> one digit</strong> in your password</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"multiplelogins\">Keep your Account Credentials Private</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharing user account credentials with fellow team members might raise a question on data security. Therefore, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HackerRank has introduced a feature that adds an extra layer of security to your <strong>HackerRank for Work </strong>account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this feature, if you try to log in to your HRW account while the same remains active in multiple other devices or browsers, you will receive a warning message prompting you to either cancel this log in or log out from the existing sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you choose to <strong>continue</strong> with the new login, you will automatically be logged out of existing sessions and logged into the current one.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360056608814\" alt=\"Error_version_2.1-New.png\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have started to roll out this feature to customers and will soon make it live to your organization. You can request this feature for your account at support@hackerrank.com if you need it on priority.</span></p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a mandatory authentication check that the system performs and it cannot be turned off. </span></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider changing your account password if you see the message again and again. </span></p>\n<h3>Inactive Session Timeout</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an enterprise organization that is particular about compliance and security, you might want to ensure the security of your data by implementing a strict session inactivity timeout limit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a company admin of the HackerRank for Work account of your organization, you can set a threshold, beyond which, if any session within your organization is inactive, then the same will be automatically logged out. Follow the below steps to set session timeout in your HackerRank for Work account.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Login to your HackerRank for Work account.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the </span><strong>Settings</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> option from the top-right drop-down of your account.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/17303839862035\" alt=\"User\"></span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the left-hand panel of your Account Settings page, click on the </span><strong>Compliance &amp; Security </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">option.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scroll down to the </span><strong>Timeout Inactive Session </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">section. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tick in the “</span><strong>Enable timeout for inactive sessions” </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">checkbox and set the inactivity time limit for your organization. Any session, that stays beyond this set threshold, will get automatically logged out of the network.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can set any time limit between 30 minutes to 24 hours as the threshold for inactive session timeout.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/17314119422867\" alt=\"Compliance\"></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note:</strong> This setting is available to Company Admins only. And, if you do not wish to set an inactivity timeout limit for your organization, then, any inactive session within your organization will automatically get logged out after 24 hours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users will get below the message on their screen if they stay inactive beyond the threshold value set by the company admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360048336894\" alt=\"session_timeout.png\" width=\"497\" height=\"140\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On clicking on the </span><strong>Login </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">button, users will be redirected back to the Account login page. Please note that any unsaved progress in the previous session will be lost if the session goes inactive and the same user or any other user logs in after that.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While setting up the inactivity time limit ensure to maintain a balance between usability and security so that your team members can comfortably carry out their activities within the application, without their sessions frequently expiring. We recommend setting 30 mins as the threshold value. </span></p>\n<h3>Close your Account After the Work is Over</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another good practice to ensure data security is to close your session when work is over. After making any change always save your work and once your work is over, log out from your account. This reduces the chance of other entities(authorized or unauthorized) accessing your system or losing important data.</span></p>","title":"Enhancing your Account Security on HackerRank for Work"}
