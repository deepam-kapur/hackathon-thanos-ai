Many companies use the HackerRank platform to conduct their campus hiring programs for selecting the right talent among them to suit your company's business requirements. For candidates, the platform is used to attend the hiring company's assessments and display their coding and technical skills to potential employers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a good practice to familiarize your Candidates with the HackerRank platform before your hiring process begins. Communicate with your candidates about how HackerRank assessments work and what they can expect or how long it may take. These practices reduce any surprises for your candidates and help maintain a positive atmosphere during each step of the hiring process. This article will help you with a few important aspects to consider in making the hiring process a success. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating Tests</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create tests in HackerRank based on a specific role, or you can even choose to customize your tests to suit your company’s hiring requirements. In role-based tests, you can generate Tests by including skill-mapped questions from the HackerRank library for HackerRank-created roles. In customized tests, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can build a Custom Test to include Questions that assess Candidates for a specific job role, experience, and skill level. You can also include Questions from the HackerRank built-in Library or your company library.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refer to the following articles to understand the Test creation process.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006434388-Creating-a-new-Test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a new test</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010826973-Creating-a-Test-Based-on-Specific-Role\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating Tests based on Specific Role</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010838053-Creating-a-Custom-Test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a Custom Test</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inviting Candidates </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you are done creating your tests, you can start inviting your candidates whom you want to take part in this assessment by sending them an email invitation containing the link to </span><strong>Start Test. </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refer to the following articles to learn how to invite candidates.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010645833-Inviting-Candidates-to-a-Test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inviting Candidates</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010822713-Using-a-Custom-Email-Invite-Template\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Using Custom Email Templates</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure that you provide the correct Time and Date in the invitation mail.
