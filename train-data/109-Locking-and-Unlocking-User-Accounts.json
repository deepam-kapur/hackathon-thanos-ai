Locked user accounts do not belong to any team and do not have access to any shared resources. Also, a locked account cannot be added to any team. When necessary, you can reuse these accounts by unlocking them and you can add them to the required team, share resources, and so on.</p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: A user account is automatically moved to a \"<strong><em>Locked</em></strong>\" state when you remove the account from all the Teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When a recruiter using HackerRank for Work quits your organization, you remove the user account from all the associated teams.</li>\n<li>The account is then automatically moved to the '<em><strong>Locked'</strong></em> state.</li>\n<li>When a new recruiting member takes over, you unlock the existing account and assign it to the recruiter's team.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Locking User Account(s)</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have logged in as a user with <strong>Company Admin</strong> or <strong>Team Admin</strong> privileges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Locking and Removing User from a Team</h3>\n<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On successfully logging into your HackerRank for Work account, click on the arrow next to the user icon on the top right corner of the homepage.
