These settings allow you to moderate and improve test access permissions and usability. You can create either a Public Test or Private Test URL and share it with the candidates. This article takes you through creating a Public and Private test URL. Also, it guides you in setting the Test Expiration Time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01H8CHSFXDVP94HJGPBKVG8406\">Modifying Test Access Settings</h2>\n<h3 id=\"01H8CHSFXDBKX7KEB3XQZ8RBQ8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Test URL </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a public test that can be accessed by anyone who has the link to the test. These links can be shared with job descriptions, and candidates applying for the position can take the test to prove their skills. Public tests do not require a password, but candidates are required to enter their email ID and any other additional information that the recruiter has configured.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must be logged in to your HackerRank for Work account</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must have created a test.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the </span><strong>Tests</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tab on the home page and click on the required test.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the test opens, click the <strong>S</strong></span><strong>ettings</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> option and select the <strong>T</strong></span><strong>est Access </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">settings. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon clicking on test access, you will see the </span><strong>Public Test URL</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> creation option on the right. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><strong>Public test URL</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> area, select the number of <strong>Expected participants.</strong></span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then enter the custom URL and click on the </span><strong>Create Link </strong>button<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/19764837224211\"></span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<center><em> Test access settings </em></center>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To generate the custom link, you can specify a unique name.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If creating a test for a Senior Java Developer, you can specify the custom URL as senior-java-developer.

A prompt indicating this is displayed and you have to publish a test before creating a public test URL.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"01H8CHSFXDJW13AX169M4W64AR\">Private Test URL </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a private test (password protected) that can be accessed through a link. Unlike public tests, you cannot access this test without a password. Creating these tests is useful when you want to have control over who can access the test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tests are especially preferred in recruiting events where it is a best practice to change the password after candidates log on to the test. Again, when the recruiting event concludes, the password is updated to revoke access to the test.  </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example: </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you are conducting a test on campus. You can share the link and password with the candidates, and after they log in, you want to ensure that no one else can access this test. So, you can change the password again. However, this will not impact the candidates already logged on to the test with the previous password.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In campus recruitment events, you should change the password 5 to 10 minutes into the test. This ensures that no external candidates can access the test. In this case, even if the initial password is disclosed to the external candidates, they cannot log on to the test because the password has been changed.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><strong>Test Access </strong>Settings, i<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n the </span><strong>Private URL</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> area:</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the custom URL and then click on the </span><strong>Create Link </strong>button.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To generate the custom link, you can specify a unique name.</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are creating a test for a Java Developer, you can specify the custom URL as java-developer.

Choose 10, 20, and 30 minutes as the inactivity timeout period for a test assessment. By default, 20 minutes is selected. When the inactivity period has elapsed, the candidate has the option to click <strong>continue working</strong> within 60 seconds. After that, all workspaces in the test are paused. Similarly, when resuming, all workspaces in the test are resumed.</div>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note: </strong>Pause and resume does not work for DevOps questions and certain questions on the older Jupyterlab platform in Data Science.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/16647318827667\" alt=\"Intelligent_Workspace.jpg\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em>Intelligent Workspace (Pause and Resume)</em> </p>\n<h3 id=\"01H8CHSFXD1V760KF411B1WXMW\">Test Expiration Time</h3>\n<p>This is the time frame within which the <strong>test URL</strong> remains active. It is helpful when you want to conduct timed tests or hiring events with a specific end date or time.</p>\n<p>Candidates can access the test at any point in time within the set date and time range, and the test link expires beyond that.</p>\n<p><em>Example</em>: If you have selected <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">20th April 2017</span> as the start date, <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">10:00 hours</span> as the start time, <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">20th April 2017</span> as the end date, and <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">13:00 hours</span> as the end date, then candidates can access and attempt the test only between 1<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">0:00 hours to 13:00 hours on 20th April 2017</span>. After this duration, the test link becomes invalid.</p>\n<p>Please note that this time frame signifies the validity of the test URL only and not the duration in which candidates need to finish the test. So, if a test that is 60 mins long expires at 13:00 hours on a given date and a candidate starts the test at 12:55 hrs, then also they will get 60 mins to complete the test. However, the link becomes invalid if a candidate tries to start the test at 13:01 hours.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>Test Access</strong> settings, in the <strong>Test Expiration Time</strong> area, set the start date/time and end date/time for the test.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/4402602265235\" alt=\"Test_Access_-_Test_Expiration.jpg\" width=\"575\" height=\"276\"></p>\n<center><em> Setting the period for which the Test will be active </em></center>\n<p class=\"box info\"><strong>Note</strong>: You can select the start date and time of the test prior to the current date and time; however, the end date and time of the test must fall after the current date and time.</p>\n<p class=\"box info\">The Proctoring settings that were available in the <strong>Test Access</strong> tab have been moved to the <strong>Test Integrity</strong> tab.</p>\n<p class=\"box info\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/9175409573523\" alt=\"banner_proctoring.png\"></p>","title":"Modifying Test Access Settings"}
