There are various reasons for this disinterest, including those driven by candidates, customers, or HackerRank, and we’ve tried to address most of them in this document.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some best practices to mitigate the candidate drop-off at various stages of the hiring funnel.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Best practices to mitigate test invite drop-off <br>(Entry and Junior levels)</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure recruiters build out a detailed and exciting candidate invite </span><a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010817373-Creating-an-Email-Template\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">email template</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> talking about company culture, team, interview process, and next steps.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure recruiters set clear <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000109287-Modifying-Candidate-Settings-for-Tests#candidate-details\" target=\"_self\">test instructions</a> about the role and skills going to be assessed, along with the next steps in the interview process.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure candidates take the sample test to familiarize themselves with the HackerRank platform and build confidence to take the assessment. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Share</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the </span><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Interview Prep Kit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> page (for additional warm-up challenges) in the email invite/test instructions.</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set up automated <a href=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000195788-Modifying-Email-Settings-for-Tests#reminder-emails\">Reminder emails</a> through the platform.
