During the coding process, the read–eval–print loop involves the programmer more frequently than the classic edit-compile-run-debug cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To know how REPL works, take a look at how a Python programmer uses REPL to write a program to add 2 numbers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/360043823873/ezgif.com-optimize.gif\" alt=\"ezgif.com-optimize.gif\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, the programmer tries running the </span><strong>add2Numbers(a,b) </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">function with multiple cases to ensure correctness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read Eval Print Loop, as its name suggests supports the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read — Read user input in realtime</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Eval — Evaluate blocks of code</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Print — Prints result to the user</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Loop — Repeat code using loops</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since REPL loads the functions and variables into memory, it also supports autocompleting the function using &lt;Tab&gt; key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">REPL is officially supported for interpreted programming languages like </span><strong>Python</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><strong>Javascript</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><strong>Ruby</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-repl\"> <strong>Java9</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and</span><a href=\"https://swift.org/lldb/\"> <strong>Swift5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have also launched official REPL support in the last few years. For other programming languages, there are third-party REPL’s which can be used.</span><br><br></p>","title":"REPL [ Read — Eval — Print — Loop] "}
