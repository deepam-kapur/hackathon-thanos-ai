This is to ensure a good number of registrations for the event. Additionally, publishing in our community can also help you get candidates to the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Once you publish your microsite on various avenues, candidates will start registering for this event. Based on whether your event is Individual or Team-based, the registration process works as follows:</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HSVH0NW8SR9X3RMKC804M0SB\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\"> Registration for an</span><span style=\"color: #434343;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Individual Challenge</span>\n</h3>\n<p>For an individual event, a candidate is asked to share their information to register for the event. </p>\n<p><strong>Candidate experience for an individual challenge</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/27381534507155\" width=\"310\" height=\"438\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HRWM85S1MK2NQZS28KJM2MH9\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Registration for a Team-based Event</span></h3>\n<p>However, for a team based event, a candidate needs to register as a team leader along with adding their team info. Using the team info, HackerRank Engage sends out an email to all the team members to register for the team that the team leader registers. You can see the difference in the candidate experience for a team leader vs a team member below:</p>\n<p><strong>Team-leader registration experience with the team-info</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/27381534524819\" width=\"300\" height=\"424\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Team-member registration experience</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/27381534536083\" width=\"295\" height=\"410\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRWM85S13EC9RCRDY4EMT4M7\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Import Candidates with a CSV Upload</span></h2>\n<p>Finally, you can also connect your ATS and CRMs through the CSV upload capability to bring in candidates from your own pool.</p>\n<p>To import candidates from your own ATS and CRM, click on the <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">overflow or kebab menu</span> </span>at the top right corner and click <strong>Import candidates</strong>. In the modal that opens up, upload a CSV with the Name and Email ID of candidates to bring in your own candidates. If in doubt about the format, download the sample CSV shown in the modal and start uploading your candidates onto Engage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/article_attachments/27381510742547\" width=\"624\" height=\"241\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"></span></p>\n<p>As the next step, you need to reach out to these candidates and nudge them to register for the event. You can do that by Applying the filters (if there are any).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the candidates using the checkbox.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Email</strong>.</li>\n<li>Edit the Email and send the email to the candidates.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This will help you send a one-time nudge email to all the candidates you have imported to register for the event. </p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: The email content needs to have the microsite link to allow these candidates to visit your microsite and register.
